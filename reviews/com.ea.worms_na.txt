Doesnt work :( just says force close. Bummer im a big worms fan i really wanted to play. Please fix!!!
This game is excellent after the most recent update. It runs smoothly on my HTC EVO 4G. Controls work well, but it takes time to adjust.
Nostalgic Worm-Kicking Action! Its so freaking cool to get to re-experience worms on my Android device! It's very true to the original PC game. However, user controls need improvement - especially the Ninja Rope. It's impossible to operate the Ninja Rope with the on-screen arrows as is. Also, I'd like to have the ability to turn off time limits in Quick Game mode.
Never works. Unistalled and tried multiple times. No android support. Rip off. Too bad I was looking forward to it.
Force close on MT3GS.... Was really looking forward to this one :( Edit: still force closing, my touch 3g slide
Really good game just do the deleting step off one of the comments, games great controls are designed well I love worms!
perfect app if you want to donate $3 to the IDEA of Worms on droid... force closes upon opening cert on STOCK xperia x10.
The dude who posted that this worked with his Vibrant must be doing something I'm not. It won't even open, just checks for updates & FC. Vibrant 2.1
Force closes for captivate :-(... and I play this all the time on my PlayStation
Force Closes before it even opens. EA better come out with an update that fixes this soon.
Said it needed to download 40mb of data, downloaded 5 and closed, waste of money!!! I think i'll stick to armored strike.
Wont let me open force closes ALL the time please fix mytouchslide 3g it can get a higher rating...
ont start up and the download took 15 min. So now I cant get refunded.

work on my G2 past license start... now it appears stuck on "checking for updates"
Force close HTC Evo. Uninstalling and waiting for later upgrade. 5 star game potential, but give 1 since I can not even use it.
Does not work on my G1... oh well, I was so anxcious to play it... :-(
Couldn't play it. Phone restart did not help. Refunded. Mytouch 4g. Will probably download out again when fixed.
Didn't want to launch on my Evo and I tried multiple times even after hard reset. Got a refund.
App closes after license says start. EA Needs to fix, it's a killer game. I wanted for free since EA didn't tested. - Nexus S -

REALLY small on my EVO. Hard to control, and instructions are vague. Would be easier on my Tab, but not supported yet... Looking forward to updates
I loved this game on pc back in the day. I really wish it would work on my Samsung Transform:-(
I don't know what everyones problem is but this game runs great on my vibrant. Great voices. Beautiful graphics. My fave game by a longshot.
Its okay. Some minor bugs here and there, including sound popping. Very disappointed "multiplayer" doesn't mean with actual people...5 stars if so.

Doesn't work on Mytouch slide 3g. Force close after download, tried rebooting photos didn't help.
15 min refund is a little dumb. It is taking longer then that for the update. So basically expect no refund
Works flawless on nexus S I was so happy to find it.* Philip how is $3 for a quality game too much and 40mb goes to your SD card not internal storage
I wasted $2 on this app expecting hours of fun gameplay especially because of the price but all I got was problem after problem less than 1hour into downloading it.  After multiple resets and reinstalls I'm done unless they fix major issues with this
Please make available for nexus 7.
Good app...but the second 2 fingers hit the screen the games unplayable. Wish I noticed this while still in the window for a refund, dev needs to fix this bull**** ASAP!
Doesn't work with nexus 7
Only multipayer is only if you pass the same phone between players, unlike worms on iphone which allows multiple phones to send moves. Ok if you like playing against the computer, however controls suck kinda ruins worms for me all together.
Please update! Worked on my GS2 until my phone updated. Now the controls no longer work.
5 minutes into game I always loose control of my team touch screen stops responding.have to exit game.
Cixx
This game is filled with issues. WARNING!!! Buyer beware.
Andriod market will a refund'. Even if you switch the the device and the model doesn't. They want these companies to guarantee the Android market or Google plus apps to work on all tablet PC's.
Every time I try to move it just sits there and runs the timer out. I close it, works for a minute, then as soon as my turn comes up again, freezes. Worked fine on my older inspire, but  on the note, its worthless.

wouldnt work for me :(
On my galaxy skyrocket this game was aweaome but ob my new s3 i cant make a move without it getting stuck in walk mode. Cant choose or fire weapons. Game went from an easy 4 or 5 stars from my old phone to a 1 star game with my new phone. I will say they probly need to update to work with ics.
Does not work on this phone so if this is what you have dont download it. The company should of made sure it worked first. Use to love this game. Not anymore, fix the galaxy sIII version.........
Freezes when you use zoom and use the pause menu also controls of worm movement irratic please fix !!!!!!!!! And no help from EA donot buy
Touch controls consistently stop functioning. Give me back my 2bucks or fix please and thanks.
I play it on my SG II.When playing it the touch screen freezes and doesn't responds.Good game, but serious problem for a paid app
Used to play this game all time on xbox.. Freezes on pause menu and worms go wherever.. Only thing that does work is the zoom please update this game... Aslo running (ICS)
I want my money back nothing works
NaN error  Samsung Galaxy Tab 2
I love Worms, I just wish I could actually play it. On my Transformer Infinity I'm getting NaN (which stands for Not a Number) instead of a percentage when the game tries to download the extra data. Then it tells me to close the app and download again, but that never works. HEY EA, FIX YOUR GAMES! I wish I could give this app zero stars.  Here's my advice, do not buy games from Electronic Arts until they wise up.
I always loved the original Worms games but this one just makes me sad and angry. I have not been able to get through a single game without the touch controls freezing on my Galaxy S II. If I was on the team that developed this software I would petition for the game to be recalled, refunded and forgotten.
Constantly gets  locked up in screen presses ie. walking when you aren't even touching the screen, zooming when you are only using one finger, etc. I love this game, it's just a shame it isn't ported properly and EA doesn't want to do anything but collect money. ASUS Transformer Prime TF201
I can't even get through a "quick game" without glitches and zoom problems. Of course, as it took me 18 minutes to realize this, not 15, I couldn't return/refund the game. The second time I downloaded the game, it froze on the help/options screen. I tried to get help from the developer's website, but they didn't recognize the game title "worms". Do not buy.
Doesn't work on the Galaxy  SIII. And from the looks of other unsatisfied customers, on a bunch of other phones too. When I tried e-mailing the company for a refund, I just received a completely irrelevant automated response. I guess the same idiots that design the games, tend customer service as well.
My Galaxy S2 was just updated to android 4.0 ice cream sandwhich and now my worms game freezes up when i pause, and when i double touch the screen to slide the view. I have uninstalled, reinstalled, troubleshoot etc... No other programs or games have issues, JUST WORMS... fix it PLEASE!!!! Once fixed you get five stars. Right now i cant even play it anymore.
How can one game have so many unacceptable errors? Effectively unplayable.
This game will not let me get refund
I can't say I'm surprised that a game this buggy was produced by EA given they're "f you, consumer" track record. Touch controls stopped responding on the 3rd move of the 1st lvl! They even found a way to screw you out of the 15 min window for a refund by requiring a 40mb dl AFTER the purchase. Avoid!
Works great on my evo. Got the new galaxy and same as many tablet. Terrible on my prime. Ea needs to update all their games, they're holding the droid os back.
Was a very big fan on my ipod touch but this version not only has a lot less options like custom game but also just runs bad.and its not my phone as its new and the best on the market.controls are sometimes unresponsive ruining a long game.seriously its terrible DONT BUY
Game requires additional 40mb download, but it hits 100% and never installs. Rip off, please refund.
Controls go all screwy after using jet pack or zooming. Droid razr maxx
This game will pick a random moment and just become unresponsive.  It seems to happen most often when moving the camera around it zooming in and out.  The weapon menu and fire buttons will sometimes disappear, sometimes worms constantly walk one direction or the other, or just now I couldn't get the worm to walk at all, only jump/backflip. Also when this happens, you can bring up the pause menu, but then you can't do anything but go to homescreen and FC.  It feels like it runs great while it works.
Work great until I upgraded OS. Now everytime I zoom or pan it freezes. I have to hit the home screen button to exit out.   It is disappointing, PLEASE FIX.
Game won't work on my galaxy s3. Lame and they stole my money to boot. F u seriously
Trying to play on a Galaxy Nexus and the game will hardly recognize any touch input.
Now only gets to title screen and exits.. $2 to play it once on a droid x.. -.-
Was a four star rating but only played it like five times and now its all glitchy and unplayable  please fix or refund the money.
Like others I've gotten stuck on the 40mb download... it never even seems to start. Eventually it fails completely with no indication a s to the cause.   Feeling a bit robbed.
Keeps freezing and controls suck
Have touchscreen issues, is very frustrating trying to play it, then worms keeps walking by itself or not responding, i love the game but not like this, pleas update it (samsung galaxy s2)
On galaxy nexus, If you try to zoom or move the screen, all controls lock up
Wish I could still get a refund.  This is really poorly made and hard to view the screen. When I zoom in, I can't even exit the game properly
Doesn't work on Android 4.x. Game starts fine but always hangs shortly.
Just bought this game and it wont even complete the download....It gets all the way to 100% and then freezes
Controls keep freezing up. Could be awesome.....
It plays for maybe a minute then the touchscreen controls go bonkers and your toast and have to restart.  And I so loved this game on the pc back :'(
This game is unfinished, tones of bugs really annoying. Hey fix it or give me my money back.
I have a HTC EVO V  . Touch screen does not work properly thus rendering the game useless. Graffics looked good.
It worked fine on my EVO 4G, but when I switched to the EVO LTE, the input would randomly start ghosting or not work all together. Great game when it worked, but since it doesn't, 1 star. Do not buy.
When zooming or panning, the game gets stuck with ghost input. Deal breaker.
This wont download the 40mb of data needed. It shows an error message Nan.
HTC One V : Can't even start the game  , update it please. I wasted my money on this and its been more than 15 so no refund. Dissipointing.
Having the same NaN problem as other people
Worms did not work on my phone (HTC One X).  It would freeze after a couple minutes.  I installed the game just before boarding a plane therefore Google Play would not refund my money because the 15 minute window had passed.  I emailed EA and they didn't refund my money either!  DO NOT INSTALL!!!
Wont even download way to mess up a classic! Try telling people it has a additional 40 mb before they download!
Loved the game, very prone to glitches and hard to control. Great attempt but needs a lot of work.
Evo4g Update made screen not work in app. Emailed ea and they referred me to a FAQ page. No help at all
Downloaded and then it demands that I download 40 more mb of content. Then it doesn't download, just sits there not downloading and eventually fails. Seriously?
Perhaps because I live in Japan. Game refuses to even download, just is stuck on ０／４０mb。 No error message, its just stuck. I have a docomo Samsung Galaxy tab 7.0 plus.
Not working on s2 after upgrade to ICS.  Freezing and loss of player control even after factory reset.  Waiting for an update to a great game :-(
Controls are buggy after a few turns. So much so that you can't even properly exit the game to start over. You have to kill the app in the task manager then reopen it to play for another 30 seconds. Total waste of time and money.
Worked ok on my razr until ics, then it went down hill. Controls disappear or won't work at all. Needs an update and soon.
It only works once and a while. The cosing must be terrible
Touch response doesn't work hardly at all on galaxy S3.please fix
Always crashes
Game doesn't work.  I'd be happy to share details, in fact I did, but your auto-replying email bot didn't seem appreciative.  Typical EA.  Lost half your stock price in 9 months, looking forward to your bankruptcy.  To your new CEO: enjoy your inevitable golden parachute for driving the company into the ground.
Does not let you use buttons. Can not play on tablet. Freezes when paused. Have to kill in task manager to get out of app.
Game frequently locks up or won't even go past "looking for updates".
Touchscreen bugs on my transformer...
What a huge disappointment.  I wish I had read the reviews before paying for this. The controls often lock up,  requiring you to close the application with a task manager. This is truly the worst port of such a great game. I have no idea how EA could have ever released this as it currently is.
When you zoom or touch two finger it bug
Won't complete the second download. Ea will not get back to me about getting a refund. Don't waste your time
LOVED the game on the original console. HATE the app. Cant even get through 1 game without some pathetic glitch. A real disappointment Forsure.  :(
Total rip off 2$ to play five minutes and restart the game to play another five minutes ... over and over again... blah. f u ea .... and im not giving u one star i give u 1/4 of the star .
I pinch to zoom and my worm jumps. Sometimes touching the sides to make him walk make him fire. Every time, after a few minutes, the touchscreen stops responding altogether. Not stable enough that they should be charging for this app yet.
Makes the game unplayable
Very disappointed.   Looks great.  Controls are fine.  However, the game is very buggy to the point of almost being unplayable.   Game becomes unresponsive as the worm I was at one point controlling starts uncontrollably moving. Game needs to be force killed and the restarted to get it responsive once again.   On galaxy nexus.
Always gets stuck on downloading, the "NaN" problem.
If you tuch the screen in multiple places like when using the ninja rope the touch won't release and your worm will just march to his death.  Motorola Xoom
*Read above tittle*
*Read above tittle*
Why no ad-hoc games??? Fix this amd would get 5 stars. Also no tablet support?
Bought for my tablet. Installs fine but won't  download the rest on my wifi only tablet. Oh well dindt get riped off to bad works on my phone.
Do not buy.  It will not download the 40mb to play the game.  Galaxy nexus.
iOS has Worms 2 AND it now has asynchronous online play (like words with friends). PLEASE bring that to Android!!
Since I installed it, i tried to download the extra 40 megabytes of data. All I keep getting some stranger error. Don't buy.
Game didn't even pretend to work. Worm just walked right and screen did not respond to touch. Really disappointing i was excited for this. Galaxy nexus.
Unplayable on my AT&T HTC One X as well. It launches just run, runs really smooth, but the input gets stuck a lot of times. Have to use task manager to kill it because it won't respond or my worm will just keep running in 1 direction.    Coming from an iPhone, this is unsettling that the first game I buy doesn't work.
I bought the game and loved playing it. Now they took it away from me >:( WHAT THE HELL GUYS!
I thought this game was a steal at this price but any two finger move locks it up,very disappointing.  I am now convinced ea can do nothing right,they find ways to screw up even a simple mobile game
Not working on samsung galaxy young plz fix
No updates planned and it doesn't work on ice cream sandwich.
When I open it,  it says download this stuff or it won't work.  When I press the download button,  it says it can't do it and I need wifi.  The thing is,  I have wifi,  why won't it work?  Don't download if you are using the tablet I'm using.
Downloaded up to 100%  3 different times then froze.
I love worms. Too bad you can't play it. What lousy programming. Too many glitches to count. Wtf. I want my money back
Can't download goes into nan error on Dell streak 7, waste of 2 bucks, don't download!
1 star cuz randomly freezes. Using android 4.0 ota on htc sensation.
A really great game. Just wish it had wifi multiplayer!
Touch screen interface screws up.  Galaxy nexus.
I have tried downloading this game about 4 times now.  It states that it has downloaded 100% but its unplayable!! This app should at least give a free trial of some kind for all of us that cannot play. Would save us a little time and $$$$$$$  -samsung galaxy precedent, lg optimus FAILURE!-
Great game, but any use of multi touch makes it unplayable. The only reason I'm giving it one star is because EA games is never gonna fix this.
Bought the game and the license doesn't work on my phone. Now I have to go through the hassle of getting my money back.
Game will not let me open it says error has occurred must force quit I don't recommend wasting your money for this game
Gets stuck on initial download showing only "nan" ... Too bad. Was fun while it worked for the last year on my evo 3d. Guess ea hates Samsung... (errors on tab 2 and epic 4g touch.)
Controls suck. Moving sucks.  Just unimpressed overall
It doesn't work all the time. Keeps freezing. Waste of money, very very unsatisfied!!!
Lame game w/ poor interface and controls.
Will not download the game files, just hangs at download screen with the progress bar. Do the devs read this? Please help
Sucks I can't even play the game, NAN error right from the beginning.
This game is functionally broken. I can not move or zoom the screen and couldn't even keep control of my worms' actions. Refunding.
I've bought this game on every platform I've ever owned because I love playing it; I've had great experiences with this game on DOS, MacOS, Windows, PS3, and iOS. However, when I bought it for Touchpad and subsequently Android and BOTH ports were horribly unplayable, I realized Team17 has stopped producing good software software.  1. When I launched the app on my Android 4.0 device, the app showed NaN when it tried to download content and never actually opened 2. When I found a workaround on online that involved manually installing the game files with the terminal, I did get the game to launch. However, once I used two fingers to zoom, the game started ignoring other touch input. Only after clicking tons of buttons (menu, back, etc) did it start responding to touch input again, but when it did that, it would only do one action -- no matter what I pressed, I would walk right. I tried restarting and got a similar problem, except this time it would just hold fire down.  What a terrible thing you have done to this franchise by producing poor, unplayable, ports for every mobile operating system you can get your hands on (except iOS, where Worms worked perfectly). Shame on you, Team17.
Zooming breaks the game on htc sensation with Android 4.0
I loved these games on PC and consols but this is horrible.  Controls are clunky, zoom function makes them much worse. If I zoom in I cant move, anywhere I touch makes me fire, zoom out and I can only move right. Not so great on HTC sensation either, control problems.  Fix the bugs, then 5 star.
Until an update is issued don't waste your money
I am a big fan of this classic  game but I can't play through a single level without a bug or glitch occurring. Not worth my money.
I keep getting HEAP 0 out of memory errors and the app force closes itself in multiplayer.  Cmon!  I love how the AI routinely makes impossible shots too.
Transformer, runs great but the controls just don't work all. Really dispointed
Can't even play because the 40 mb of content won't even download.  Some kind of nan error.
Worked fine.  Now doesn't load and drops me straight to home.  Epic 4g (not touch) sph-700
I love the game. Had it on PC and now on my Acer iconia and it works great right up until you touch it with more then 2 fingers. Then it locks up and I have to force close thru task manager.
When trying to launch it the first time after install, I got a message saying it needed to download an additional 40 MEGS of data before it would run. It recommended connecting to WiFi. So I connected to my WiFi network and clicked 'Download.' That was about three hours ago. The download is painfully slow and keeps failing a fraction of the way through. Although it says progress has been saved and I should click Retry, progress had NOT been saved and it starts from the beginning. Like I said, I've been at this for three hours now, so the lousy 15-minute window for a refund has long been closed. Note: My WiFi works fine, both with my desktop PC and my Asus eePad. If I didn't love Worms so much (it worked fine on my old iPhone...and didn't need a 40-meg download) I'd have given up on it by now, but I'm going to keep trying. BTW: this is happening on an LG Optimus Q (LGE LGL55C).
This app is unplayable, the touch function are not responding when i get in the game. Transforme prime with ics 4.3
I have passed the 15 minute return period... regret buying it. Screen freezes after a few moves and can't do anything. Have not been Able to get one game completed.
Awful. Freezes controls won't work. HTC vivid
Will not download on pantech element, afraid to try on pantech burst
Didn't work correctly on galaxy nexus. Whether you can move out shoot us dependent on if they game wants you to. Controls don't work at all!
Leave it to EA to make the most nazi control scheme possible. Instead of have 5 on screen buttons to move you worm you have to control him by moving the screen, which should be reserved for looking around. And for looking around you have to use 2 fingers which should be used to zoom. This would be acceptable except that no matter what mode you play you can't change the really short 45 second time limit. This was OK PCs but completely impossible with these stupid controls. Ninja rope is impossible to use.
Don't but this app till they fix it lots of bugs
Was excited to play the game again and works fine until you zoom. Once you do that loose all controlls and eventually touch sensativity
Seems like the camera sticks or doesn't respond from time to time,
Zooming or any two finger gesture breaks controls.  Acer iconia A500  Otherwise it's super fun and is a nostalgia trip for sure!  HOLY HAND GRENADE
Bought app and my worm just keep jumping to the left. Refund button is gone before I can return. What a @#&% joke. Way to gank my money, greedy @#&%s at google.  Transformer Prime user
Said the app doesn't have permission to run on my android device, I paid for it too :'(
but it would be soooooo much better if u could play multi player via bluetooth or wifi!!!
Won't download the game data after running the app.
Freezing, controls missing, can't fire
I get no video feed from it. I have audio but no video. And when i do get video it me a white screen.
NaN error when trying to download the game. Lame.  Samsung 7.0 plus tab. 3.2
I paid for this app and cant even open it!!! Very disappointed!
While it appears to run okay, it doesn't respond to my touches whatsoever, they need an update badly. Galaxy nexus, Android 4.0.2
Refuses to install the patch. Waste of money
Has a download I have to get to play, but won't download...
No warning that it wont work with most androids like a DROID3
The user interface is really bad.  DO NOT BUY.
I'm very disappointed in this. I love the series, but I haven't even gotten to play it on my VIZIO VTAB1008. I want a refund asap.
Never can get through the first move without controls freezing up. Avoid buying!
I was excited to play this game, but it froze my phone, and keeps closing on me. Not so excited anymore...
It freezes up when you zoom in n out .
The game is currently unplayable due to control glitches. Do not purchase.
Don't work bad baadd baaaaddd
Installed just fine but when I start a match the controls go haywire and then u lose all control.  Can't even zoom in/out, but the game keeps rolling.  Unplayable.  Maybe needs update for ICS?  Worked fine on my 2 year old Droid.  Go figure.  If updated to work with GNexus then 5 stars cuz this game is one of the best for mobile platforms...

Fun when it works, which is not often.
Says I'm not authorized to play it on my android I'm using a Marquees if that's how you spell it
Best game ever
I installed it a month go,  and wasn't able to download 40 meg resources.  I tried again today,  still no luck. all of the EA games I've gotten havent worked.  it seems they just dont support their products.
Never worked on Atrix, doesn't work on Galaxy Nexus. EA has no intentions of updating their games to work with new devices. Do not buy.
Love this franchise. Hate EA. Touches don't register correctly. Only zooms. Can't walk, shoot or jump. Totally unplayable on my stock Galaxy Nexus.
Will not download on my phone, refund please
Game started great. Got a few rounds in, then it stopped responding to touch, then some of the UI elements such as inventory and fire buttons disappeared. No FC though. Transformer Prime ICS
I bought this game, it launched, generated a map, and then stopped responding to touch. I rebooted the phone, launched again, got into a game, and when I tried to zoom in it decided any finger placed anywhere on the screen was one finger far right, moving my worms off a cliff.  Paid games not working on the Galaxy Nexus is kinda crazy.
Will not open past title screen. didnt even get to play once. I want my money back.
Touch screen version makes game too frustrating to play.
ASuS Transformer. Does not work. I want my money back.
Screen stops responding after you first start moving.Android 3.2
It worked once and then the touch screen stopped responding during game play. It was so fun for about a minute!  Please fix this! (Google nexus)
Takes a couple rounds to really get the controls but after that its a great version of an awesome game . HTC Evo 4g
Unable to play. Freezes up, cant control. I used to love this on pc
Doesn't function properly to the point that I really don't want to play. Please make this work for ice cream sandwich properly, it has a lot of potential
Won't download the extra data, can't refund anymore
Fun game, and works great! I G2x / Vtab.
I can forgive a free app crashing every once in a while, but this crashes all the time and I paid for it and its from EA. Save your money.
Controls don't work on Galaxy Nexus.  : -(
So they sell it to me and then discover it does not work on my device and disable download.  No offer of a refund or even appology. I hope that couple of bucks was worth your companies reputation and integrity.   Not working on the Asus transformer.
Using multitouch instantly breaks controls until restart.  Should be easy to fix, and please add keyboard controls for bluetooth keyboards and transformer/tf prime tablets
Lots if fun. Good old worms
It looks just like the worms game remember,   After reading the (well presented) introduction on how to play I jumped into a quick match and got to play for about 30 seconds. After that it insisted that I was trying to walk to the right even though I wasn't, and wouldn't respond to anything else.  Since I paid good money for it I'll try it some more and hope they update it so that it's more playable, but on the whole pretty disappointing.
Haven't been able to download the "additional content" to even play the game. EA just provides useless support.  No fix yet... HTC Rezound.
On Galaxy Nexus Verizon. Whatever I press worm goes right and that's it. I paid for this please fix!
Controls don't work. Galaxy Nexus 4.0.2
Galaxy nexus 4.0.2 controls don't work. Anything I press just moves the worms in the same direction. Please fix! I want this game to work.
Just the worms game I remember, other than it freezes after one game.  Will put 5 stars once it's fixed.
Pleass don't ruin this excellent game. Controls go crazy every time after moving camera with two fingers For those wo are consering this game, just DON'T BUY IT until EA fixes this bug. It is totally unplayable.
When you put two fingers down to move the camera, the game goes crazy and doesn't propery take any new touch input. If this were fixed, it would be 5 stars. Until then, the game is unplayable.
Broken on ICS no bug fix in sight. EA spend a few dollars and fix your broken crap.
I love the game and just wish it wouldn't freeze every time I try to play it on my Motorola xoom.
Waste of money. Played halfway through the game, buggy controls and all, and the game uninstalled itself. Only app ever to do this on my phone.
It would be great if it wouldn't lock up every time you try to use any Multi-Touch action.  Called EA and their response was "well that should really be handled by the developer" after I pointed out that they are the developer they told me that since its a port there is almost nothing that can be done.  Please use extreme caution when buying this app.
Just got everyone info, this game has no online multiplayer like the psp version, so don't buy it. Games like these are designed for online play
Will load everything except graphics.  I get to a white screen and can hear familiar worms noises, but cannot see anything.
Don't waste your money or time! It keeps downloading gets to 100% then locks up.
There is no support for this game at all, controls lock up 5 minutes into the game, no point in playing!
DO NOT BUY THIS!!!  The dev doesn't care and you should consider this game abandoned.  Download errors, hangs, force closes on both XOOM and Bionic. Even BSOD'd my Bionic and it needed a battery pull. I couldn't even start the game.  I sent an email to the address given here asking for a refund (the 15 minute window was up after all that crap above) and it's an automated response email address that directs you to the website where you'd have to register first to even get to "chat online" with their rep.
Controlls freeze up randomly, the game is unplayable. ASUS TF101
Doesnt work crap
Part way through the game the controls stop working then it freezes up. Would rate it higher if i could actually play a full game. Uninstalled and reinstalled it and still does the same. Dont waste your money on this game.
Poor quality. No support (the email listed only sends a stock response.) Game sometimes stops responding to touch input, event though my tablet is still working fine.  Crashes when you plug in or unplug the keyboard.  No excuse for the poor quality of programming.
Works ok on EVO but wont load on Xoom.  NaN message when trying to download/complete the install.  This game would rock on a larger interface.  Game play just not practical on a small screen the way the controls are layed out.  Loved the PC versions and kudos for getting the port this far.  Was hoping to pass down this gaming tradition to my kids.
Average Game keeps uninstalling itself. Its happened twice in a 24 hour period. Other than that its pretty good. Won't load all the time. Fix bugs.
I was really hoping this would work but it didn't. :/
Do sent work on my xoom, I wish it did .. ya dig
The game won't download additional content after installation. Download indicator stuck with NaN message...Asus Transformer, Android 3.2.1
Good game but keeps crashing on my inspire 4g...
This will not work on my xoom indicates nan when trying to download the 40mb.
Indicates NaN. Motor Xoom
It won't download the extra files needed
Won't download additional file which is evidently necessary for application to run. Took me too long to determine it was not a network error. Now I cannot get a refund.
Bought it then read the reviews for xoom...fail doesn't work xoom
This game wont even work it will start up and than say license start.. than takes me back to my homepage. Wtf? retards
I'm highly disappointed in this game. The controls are confusing and way too sensitive. You should change up the controls and allow more time per move
Same issue Please refund me. Wont download the 40MB.  Xoom
Hi. I have same problem on my xoom. After install system doesnt download add content. Would be great if somebody can fix it
Won't open until I download additional content, which I'm okay with, but when i click download, it doesn't download. It fails after like 2 minutes. already tried 3 times. need help please. Motorola Xoom
Original download is less than 2mb... then requires another 40gb download. This fails and i cannot play. I'd be happy to download full 40mb to begin with... platform is a zoom
If i had not passed the 15 minute mark i would have refunded this. Horrible unresponsive controls.
Unable to download the additional files needed for game on the Asus Transformer. Disappointed.
Does not allow additional content to run the game on Xoom
Division by zero while downloading the 40mb content package at first launch. Refunded after 5 minutes
Could not download additional content on xoom.
This game is very buggy on the Motorola Atrix. If the screen locks, the game freezes. The initial download failed. The game play isn't very intuitive.
Charge for game then additional download doesn't start. Using xoom
Works great! - At&t sony ericsson xperia x10 with forced official gingerbread (2.3.4)
don't buy if you're using an eee pad...they say it's compatible but it's not...support suckz btw...
Doesn't start download :-(
40mb download doesn't start.
Does not work on HTC wildfire. Black screen after initial start. Its a 40mb download after purchasing...making the 15min market refund harder to get !
States you liscense isnt valid for this android device
Touch the screen to the left of your active character once, and he jumps 4 times to the right and frowns. This is lazy programming at best.
Won't download. Brutal.
Laggy, freezes, crashes my phone. i love this game but its unplayble. giving it one sta, not that EA even cares, they got your money. they have no will or desire to fix anything.
Ninja rope control could use some work.. good game though
Finally started seeing good reviews for this game and now it tells me this game is not authorized for use on my device. HTC Aria
The game is on of my children's favorites. I bought this while it was flawed. Now EA has fixed and works great.
EA fails yet again. Can purchase for Evo 3D, but tells you it's incompatible. Tell your programmers that the apk manifest is there for a reason.

When I bought this it didn't work on my evo 4g. Finally an update fixed it. The controls take some getting used to but once you do it's excellent.
I love this! Works perfectly on evo 4g after the update. Great game, reminds me of my younger days :)
Now the crash is fixed, and I can play it. Great game. I can't give full stars knowing they released with with a crash on boot and no fix for months

The game play as I can recall is great. Dealing with EA and trying to actually get it to run is a nightmare. After trying literally everything, moving from and to the SD card, uninstalling and reinstalling, I have to give up. Try going to the E.A. website only to find that you CAN'T contact customer support because apparently EA mobile doesn't have it in its database. So unfortunately this app gets 1 star, simply because its impossible to run. Also why is there 3 Worms app from EA? Makes you wonder...

There's a fix, search the comments and plug your phone into your CPU to do it. Fun once it works but if you're paying you shouldn't have to do a fix.
Gets to "license start" then force closes on my samsung captivate. Uninstalled and refunded...

Waste of time and money. Big fan of the old skool armegedon, doesn't work. Galaxy S
Highly disappointed. Download the extra required content, only to have it not work. Don't waste your time...
Evo 4g, Android 2.2, Sprint App would not load and trying to contact the developer has not worked. Save your money, do not bother with this app.
After it finally downloaded and updated it crashes after license load. Why put this game on the Sony Ericsson tab if it won't work on my X10? Boo-urns
Has never loaded past "license start". Don't waste your money. Known issue they are ignoring. Would love to be able to play.
Was working fine, then an update and now it either won't start or says unauthorized for your android. HTC mytouch 4g
It doesn't work with my samsung galaxy 4g phone. contacted tech support and they are not helpful
Wont dowload 40 mb data file on mytouch 4g. And I really wanted some worms on the go. EA, you can have my money back when you fix this game.

LG g2x, doesn't work. Download starts gets to 15%, then 1 second later...... 100%. Will not work afterwards. Tried clearing data and uninstalling.
Does not even start on the g2x. Says "license start" and quits. I loved the original, hope they fix this classic game.
With samsung epic game is flawless and tons of fun. I think other reviewers just have phones withouta fast enough processor.

There is NO reason to give this game a bad rating!!! unless you have a crappy phone. So DON'T blame the game for your cheap phone.. lol... 5 stars
Wtf, owned for maybe two months and still not working. You're EA and should be on this. Please fix I love this game. Nexus S

Shame on you, EA. This is the 2nd game you've robbed me of my money. Does not work on HTC Aria 2.3.2
multiple versions in the market, this is the older version. Dont pay for this one, you won't get your money back when you find the current version.

Really not that fun. Huge post-purchase file download prevents refund, so thanks for that EA...really classy.
This game is excellent after the most recent update. It runs smoothly on my HTC EVO 4G. Controls work well, but it takes time to adjust.

Brings back good old memories. Great game, runs smooth, the only problem is screen shuts off but I can fix that myself in sound and display options
I really enjoyed playing this on HTC inspire 4g, but recently got HTC one x and app locks up with no button response. Please fix! I love this game!
really cool classic but lots of bugs and not one fix yet. plus most original options have been taken out...
I would give more stars if they fixed the touch screen controls from locking up. HTC EVO LTE
Cant get through a match without the worms doing what they want freezing and the HUD disappearing
Can't play a complete game without it bugging. Screen turns half uncontrollable. Worm starts jumping on one or other direction without even  touching the screen.
I have been waiting for this to on phones forever.. just needs more customization and online play and its a perfect game... oh and its glitchy please fix it
Great game when it works. Galaxy S3. Pinching to zoom out or in causes an issue and touch commands go haywire. Unable to play after this happens.
Galaxy S2. This is for me third generation of this game. I rated it 5 stars until update the phone to ICS. The game  starts normal and after few minutes controls take over the worm and it walks by self and when paused no reaction when press button. Waiting for fix E.A  !
Played this game daily. Super addictive. Android recently updated which messed up the movement for some reason. Now I can only play for 15 seconds before it gets stuck moving left and won't allow me to exit the game. Fix the glitch and it is 5 stars.
This app has issues as far as movement and always acting up. I am very unhappy.
Need new weapons and less cheater opponents
Love this game...I hope you get the bugs worked out soon I would like to play it again!!!!
On galaxy nexus, If you try to zoom or move the screen, all controls lock up
Not compatible with nexus 7
At random I will be unable to control anything on the screen including menus.  DROID RAZR 16gb
Doesn't work on Asus transformer. Please fix
Good game but on the galaxy s 3, I keep gearing street issues. It did work on my first phone droid incredible.
Looks great and reminds me off the old worms. But then gets glitchy. Will act as if I'm constantly trying to move or jump and have to kill the app. Haven't made it through one full game yet.
I used to love this game back in the day...sigh...this version sucks.  The controls are aweful and from time to time the game stops responding to all touch inputs. Broken. Do not buy unless it is fixed.
Running on a 1g snappdragon EVO 4G.  And program will fry while opening and take the phone's operating system with it.  Needs reboot about 1/5 times.
Unplayable. Can't walk, jumps when I don't want it to. Can't get refund now either. Thanks, EA. This sucks.
Horrible controls... Unresponsive movement at some points and overresponsive at others. Buttons that don't work... A huge disappointment. Falls waaaaaay short of the original. Enjoy your $1.99
Controls seem easy enough but it keeps having touch screen issues. If the game works for you be prepared for some witty worms with explosives to brighten your day. It was fun for the first few minutes of each game play before it bugged out.
Challenges unplayable on Sony Tablet S. I don't want to be any more disappointed so I didn't try any other modes. PLEASE FIX! Worms is one of my favorite games and the apps have failed me twice...
Game didn't even pretend to work. Worm just walked right and screen did not respond to touch. Really disappointing i was excited for this. Galaxy nexus.
Game breaking bugs.  I'm using it on an Asus Transformer Prime.  Very frustrating.
Just way to many bugs, especially in the controls
I used to love this game back in college,but its super buggy. Locks up on a Toshiba thrive after you do anything to the camera.
Controllable stop working randomly
It can't play on the HTC one x needs an update
On asus transformer after 2 minutes the game becomes unresponsive. And just tapping on the screen causes it to zoom in and out over and over again.
Keeps freezing very disappointed
Game is great but has too many bugs causing control problems and crashes. Really unfortunate they dont update this title.
Great for nostalgia, but the controls are pretty awful. It's very easy to backflip to your death  while trying to aim and some items are nearly unusable. Only mildly crashy on my droid razr.
The game is fun until I try to pan or zoom, then it freezes up and I have to restart my Toshiba thrive.
I love the game; works well until I play a Multiplayer game... I always get a Memory error after the first round and the game crashes.  My bionic has ample memory and doesn't have this problem with any app but this.  When this bug is fixed i'll give it 5 but the game is unplayable until then.
The app continues to freeze and buttons stop working on Galaxy Nexus on Android 4.0 ICS
JUMPING SUCKS... JUMPING STILL SUCKS.
Controls are screwy and don't give you the precision you need.  Also there is lag between when you press the release button and when the ninja rope disengages.
Two versions of game, and i got wrong one and now.cannot  ask for refund.	Bought for xperia play, but it doesnt support the gamepad. Then noticed that there is a special version of same game for xperia play, which is twice as expensive. Dont know why there are two versions of same game. It is easy to get confused and get wrong version, like what happened to me. Suxks that cannot return the game
It works fine technically but the controls are unbearable
To many bugs. Touch doesn't work after return to game. Worm moves on own. Galaxy nexus.
Not only do you have to side load days on tablets to get it working, the touch gets all wonky on any high res screens making the game unplayable on both Transformer and Galaxy Nexus
Application seems to struggle when going from multi-touch to single-touch (i.e. single presses for the menu system cease to function, or your worm will be stuck walking and single presses in an attempt to get it to stop only pan around the game board or zoom in/out which is a double press function) on my GNex making the game unplayable at times. I would be happy to update my review when a patch is released addressing this. When it does function properly (after shutting down the application or restarting the phone) it is an awesome game.
This game runs great on my Galaxy Tab right up until the point where I try to zoom in/out, pan the camera, or really just place two fingers on the screen at the same time. At that point, the game locks up and I have to use the Task Manager to kill it.  On my Droid 2, I can't even download the additional content. I get a NaN error.
Great game EA bought it from somebody else with talent and now they don't support it, have to install it new everyday, droid bionic
Boo. Im not a fan
i die every match because of it
Works however controls are horrible. Very inaccurate. Would prefer in screen buttons
Looks great but badly needs dedicated on screen direction pad, action and jump buttons. At the moment not worth buying.
Poor control, and frequent crashes.
T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy S Vibrant, stock 2.1 Rom. The program crashes upon startup when the "license start" comes on the screen.
Great game. Would have been five stars if I had been able to play it right away instead of waiting 5 months for you to fix the crash issues.
The fix works but I needed to also download an app that let me copy and paste files. Should not have had to do that for something I paid for.
There's a fix, search the comments and plug your phone into your CPU to do it. Fun once it works but if you're paying you shouldn't have to do a fix.
I must've given this a three star rating because It's my favorite game for the 360, but it doesn't work on my evo! EA, FIX THE GAME! Please!
Does not work. My touch 4g says checking for licenses and then closes. Don't lose your money.
It crashes on license check now. Fix it people. Its crap to take peoples money like that
Confirmed Cameron's fix gets Worms up and running again on my Epic! Thanks a lot my friend!! EA can still keep my 2 stars for their crap support.
Wtf guys bought thee game wtf does liencse start mean old skool fan back from mac days fix this prob
Same game I played 10 years ago on pc!! Sweet! Works perfectly on samsung epic 4g
Loved the game on the computer...was so excited didnt read galaxy not supported... wont play on epic...
Difficult to control on touchscreen. Would prefer overlayed 'controller' similar to Snes emulator. Disappointing.
There is NO reason to give this game a bad rating!!! unless you have a crappy phone. So DON'T blame the game for your cheap phone.. lol... 5 stars
Love Worms! Been playing since Armageddon in '98. Please make compatible w/ Samsung Tab!!
Love Worms! Been playing since Armageddon in '98. Please make compatible w/ Samsung Tab!!
This game is excellent after the most recent update. It runs smoothly on my HTC EVO 4G. Controls work well, but it takes time to adjust.

Really good game just do the deleting step off one of the comments, games great controls are designed well I love worms!
Wont let me open force closes ALL the time please fix mytouchslide 3g it can get a higher rating...
People are right! U suck EA & U are NO better than a Common Thief! U always come out w/ games that dont work &then charge us' $3 Samsung Vibrant
*FIX Download/install worms 0.0.15 apk from web.Install this version.Copy missing files from /sdcard/android/data/com.ea.worms_carrier to ...worms_NA
This sucks...one of my fav games and i just wasted 3 bucks...it doesnt let you get a refund. Force close HTC G2
Been waiting for this on Android since I jumped ship on my iPhone! Runs kinda crappy on my G2. Hope this improves. Wifi multiplayer would be nice!
Love this game. Multitouch controls could be better but overall quite fun, just like the old desktop versions.
Crashed after license start. Requested refund. Will purchase again after ea fixes bugs.
Does not work on my G1... oh well, I was so anxcious to play it... :-(
App closes after license says start. EA Needs to fix, it's a killer game. I wanted for free since EA didn't tested. - Nexus S -
REALLY small on my EVO. Hard to control, and instructions are vague. Would be easier on my Tab, but not supported yet... Looking forward to updates
Used to love this game on Dreamcast, now not so much... It does run fine on my Evo with 2.3 CM7, no complaints there.
Doesn't work on Samsung Vibrant... Installed, crashed on opening. Said "License Start" then went black and back to home screen.

Used to work fine on my droid4 before the ics update. Now the worms won't respond to touch after a while. Its like it is thinking I am constantly pressing on my screen. Update please!
Awesome concept, but lots of Bugs. I'm playing on my Galaxy S3 and whenever the game pauses I can't interact with anything. None of the buttons work. It sucks especially since a payed for it. Kinda sucks, so I try to play a game without my screen locking. Also my worms only give left.
I have played this on my old phone and loved it!  Unfortunately, this game does not work on my Galaxy S3....
as soon as my droid 4 was upgraded to ics this game stopped working. was my fav game before. needs fix with new android os's
Well in a fun but to glitchy and needs more lvl and weapons and online,multiplayer and the price it would be 5
Worms only move left on my screen. Looking for a fix but it sucks that this is happening... Worms games are usually good fun.
Game seems pretty complete but anytime I pause the game I can't resume, selecting anywhere in the screen has no effect. Please fix.
Worked on my nexus and my viewsonic gtab! But not on my xoom or HTC one x, load but touch is broken So I do not buy ea stuff anymore...
As much as I love the nostalgia of playing worms again, this game Is quite glitchy when playing multiplayer.  The screen locks and doesn't allow any control while the clock continues to tick.  Very annoying.  It also really needs Bluetooth connectivity.   HTC Evo 3D
Since the last update the game has major glitches on my galaxy note. Before the update it worked and played very well.
Touch screen functionality goes haywire after a few seconds of play and requires fc. I love worms and it is very reminiscent of when I was a kid.
This is one of my favorite games but it keeps freezing up.
Skip this one until they get it ironed out.  The controls are atrocious, whenever you try to zoom or scroll the game breaks, worms get stuck in movement, occasionally take any input as a jump forward command. Its nearly unplayable.
Not working on s2 after upgrade to ICS.  Freezing and loss of player control even after factory reset.  Waiting for an update to a great game :-(
Love worms but this version is glitchy with razr and ics. Screen freezes a lot and get load errors on multi player games.
Works on my HTC vivid until I do anything involving two finger input, on my tablet that also runs ics it won't even download the additional content needed to run. Such a great game wasted... come on EA fix this!
Touch response is either highly unpredictable or nonfunctional on TF101.  Had I read some of the reviews I would have known this prior to downloading.   Fingers crossed for a update.
This installed fine on my HTC Sensation and 10" Toshiba thrive.  Works flawlessly on the phone, but on the tablet whenever you zoom or anything where multi-touch is used it has a serious glitch.  If that is fixed it would definitely be a 5 star.  My guess is its some incompatibility with the Tegra processor.
Locks up in zoom and screen scrolling
There seem to be some kind of a bug with the UI sometimes the menu buttons are not pressable. Using acer iconia a500
I loved thus game growing up... this version CONSTANTLY  freezes. I can barely get through one game before I have to restart the program. I hope they can fix this. Transformer prime
would be five stars if it had xperia compatibility
Its a fun game but to many annoying bugs please fix controls are all whacked out I was doing back flips and I couldn't press anything else
Its a great idea and they did a half-decent job plays great on my droidx but its needs better customization (levels, worms, weapon rules) but the real bummer is no online play!! Seriously $2 but no way to play online... it would be 5 stars with just that
Im disapointed,  the touchscreen stops working when you loose a match and the controls are all screwed up
I played this game for the longest time and it worked fine, now I can't even get through a match without my worms insisting on walking to the left. Frustrating, especially for a game that wasn't free.
Until this game comes out in hd this deserves 3 stars
Will not download on pantech element, afraid to try on pantech burst
Dragging around to view the arena seems to make it lose calibration and the screen buttons stop responding.  TF101.
Works okay on my Samsung Epic 4G.  It tends to freeze, but all you have to do is press home and restart the app and it picks up where you left off.  However, I'm having a hard time trying to finish even half of a round on my Asus Prime.  Please fix soon... this game is fun, but not if it doesn't work.
I love this game... But the controls are really bad I hope they do something about this.
this series is probably my favorite of all time.  i remember playing it when it was just a playable demo for my desktop, long before worms 2, armageddon, 3d, 2010, or this.  that's why this review pains me so; this game needs some serious work, particularly with jumps.  jumps are almost useless, forward and back, due to the miniscule height and distance they gain you, time per turn needs to be extended because the controls, easy mode isn't that easy, considering the imprecise controls. i love the game, tho.
Works good for a minute then the whole UI stops responding to touch, needs fix since I paid for this G2X Ics
Would be 5 if you fix the Galaxy Nexus screen bug
Faulty multi touch controls need to close game, reopen and resume to fix it. Samsung galaxy nexus on ice cream sandwich
Now, whenever play worms the controls go away and multi-touch doesn't work properly. Nexus S - android 4.0.3
Works great on my photon, but not  so great on my Asus transformer. It freezes up on zooming an 2 finger scrolling
Screen will stop recognising touch commands halfway through a turn. Unplayable 30% of the time. Have to restart the game 2x a move.
I love this game but the license checking and update checking keeps me from playing when I don't have a strong connection. This is an issue.
The controls for this game are buggy. You should avoid the multi touch controls such as moving map.
Game plays just like the old PC version and is great fun but it has all the standard EA bugs. The game needs to be reinstalled daily and the licensing issue can cause the game to freeze when you try to open it.
Fun game, controls are a little buggy and the screen timeout function doesnt seem to be working.  net play would be nice
How does landing a grenade on an opponents head do 12 damage to him and kill you?
Control issues, bugs, lack of game modes/weapons.  Otherwise its a great game!
Love the series but seriously this app needs major improvement, fix the controls in the next update, they are really messed up aneq need to be better developed,  Buttons that invole a switch from movement to weapons and aiming would be good and on screen joy pads and self centering camera control would really improve this game, please take these suggestion in serious consideration :-)  -Motorola Zoom
Awesome game all except one flaw, it crashes on me too often.  Cant wait to get an update fixing that problem!
Classic! I love this game and I always have. It is amazing on my phone, but when I tried to download it to my LG G-slate it will not download the additional License it needs to run... If this changes my rating will change to 10 stars!
Works great on nexus s. Doesn't work at all on Asus transformer.  Would be amazing on a tablet. More instruction for the artillery would help.
The game runs reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaly slow on my phone Galaxy 5 installation was good
Good game but keeps crashing on my inspire 4g...
I've played worms in numerous different formats from the days of Windows Mobile 5.x to the Wii. This is the same entertaining game that I'm used to. However, for the Android platform, it is very buggy. For example, I just exited the game and the game music continued to play even after it was closed. 2 FC's just yesterday. Hopefully they'll improve the code.
Wish it were more like Worms 2010 on my Windows Mobile phone, particularly with its option to do a adventure style format, as well as some of the other aspects of gameplay.
Works alright as long as I put my samsung epic on airplane mode butif not it tends to freeze up to where I have to reboot my phone
I don't like that it dose that dowload at the,start when  Igo into it
AI waaaay to accurate occassionally.
Memory issue makes the game force close love the game but need more weapons like the older pc version my touch .4g
though not locking the screen on is super annoying...any chance of network play?
Runs great on my HTC desire hd. Great game and lots of fun. Worth the 1$
Good. Add online multiplayer and for some reason uninstalled itself on my droid bionic
don't buy if you're using an eee pad...they say it's compatible but it's not...support suckz btw...
Plays ok on my milestone(Droid) in low quality.  Unplayable on my zoom due to some glitch in the controls (game gets stuck in multitouch control mode)
The game can be quite challenging but the controls are terrible.playing on a nexus s. the game frequently confuses move with jump.
Plays solid on Epic 4G. Force closes and crashes phone here and there, but not terrible for a dollar. Fix crashes and easily a 5 star.

Works on the G2x after using the fix. We shouldn't have to fix something we paid for... Great game but 1 star due to it not working upon install
Controlling everything with a touchscreen causes Worms to lose a bunch of its appeal. Still, it _is_ Worms.
Works great on my nexus one. Brings back memories of worms armageddon.
Ninja rope control could use some work.. good game though
Poor control, and frequent crashes.
5 stars if you get this game to work cross platform with iPhone users. IT CAN BE DONE
FINALLY fixed. Still, not NEAR as fun as the computer game. No rope? Seriously??? It's okay. Not worth the money. Maybe $0.99.
Now the crash is fixed, and I can play it. Great game. I can't give full stars knowing they released with with a crash on boot and no fix for months

After fix in these comments. Game works fine. After update game still work. Still shouldnt have to fix it ourselves or wait forever for update.
Fc. Right on license start screen. Refunded. Evo 4G running fresh. Il buy in a week, and it better work.
There's a fix, search the comments and plug your phone into your CPU to do it. Fun once it works but if you're paying you shouldn't have to do a fix.
Fix works on nexus s. Had to download a free app manager that could copy and paste.
Its cool and fun and also very easy to do I like it a lot worms is asome
Used to work great, last update makes it freeze all the time and FC :(
With samsung epic game is flawless and tons of fun. I think other reviewers just have phones withouta fast enough processor.
I want a refund people!!!! This pos will not even open when launched......just checked on EA games and it's priced lower at 1.99....http://us.eamobile
I demand an update change log.... no issues here just wanna know what the hell changed.
Performs amazingly on Evo 4G This game is very well implement, the controls are easy to use and feel very natural. Feels quite nostalgic...
Same game I played 10 years ago on pc!! Sweet! Works perfectly on samsung epic 4g
Controls suck in this game the old windows mobile version was much better i love worms but this version was poorly done
HTC aria. Pay for app and won't open. Force close. Please fix, I love this game and want to play.
Needs to make the screen not sleep and the controls are a bit tricky. Otherwise a good game.
I want to give this five stars, I really do, but I cant for the life of me understand why it runs as poorly as it does on my G2.
It's definitely Worms... but it's just not that fun to me anymore. If you love the game, you'd probably enjoy this version for sure!
Hard to control I feel but the game is great time killer concept but doesn't really play well on my phone. EVO 4G
NOT working with update. Still force closed on my captivate. Lose 1 star for making me buy a second time when I can't get a refund.
After completely removing all traces of the software and reinstalled it works great. Awesome game
After completely removing all traces of the software and reinstalled it works great. Awesome game
If it fails after "license start", delete the folder com.eamobile.worms and all its contents from sdcard/Android/data. Works well now on Epic 4G 2.1
Love the games, but the controls really suck. They need work, bad. Runs on my evo 4g.
Works fine on my hd2 buy the controls are iffy and I have to hit things multiple times
Controls are a bit wonky, but it's not nearly as bad as people are making it out to be. People trash apps before reading and figuring it out.
Works OK on my LG Optimus S. I had to uninstall, clear enough apps to free 40 mb and reinstall. Game play is a little choppy.
Does not work on my G1... oh well, I was so anxcious to play it... :-(
Works fine on my Nexus One, but controls are terrible. 90% of the time any touch of the screen makes you jump to your death.
Game starts on my Evo running Cyanogenmod 7 nightly. Sounds play with some static. No music. Runs quick though. Looking forward to updates to fix.
Its okay. Some minor bugs here and there, including sound popping. Very disappointed "multiplayer" doesn't mean with actual people...5 stars if so.
Not bad. Graphics are just ok. It might be really good on a tablet, but I don't really think it works so well on smaller screens.
Fc everytime I try to open it. Please fix or refund. Love the game and I would like to play. Garminfone
World great on my galaxy s blaze, controls are weird but manageable.
This is a very solid, enjoyable Worms game. It may not have all the features everyone would like, but it brings the Worms experience to Android for us to enjoy. The version I got from the store here does not seem to work with my Xperia Play controls though, has anyone else found a version that works with the Xperia Play hardware controls? Please let me know at troopermax(at)gmail if you have info!
Once they get the bugs worked out...
I updated to the new android os and now i can get through two turns and it freezes. Lets get that update made, asap please.
Having alot of force closes on start up trying to bring up the little box that says "license start" on Pantech Breakout, but still one of my all time favorite games!
Awesome game that brings back the memories. Needs some work and more customization option. Making it multiplayer on multiple devices is a must.
I like it but I would also like more weapons like in worms 2. And it had a campaign!!! Release an update!!!
Runs wonderfully on the Samsung Gaalaxy S2!
My current obsession,  same gameplay as  on my iPod Touch.
This is a great game, but you need a multi-touch tablet to really use it. 640x480 phone screens don't cut it here. The game takes considerable getting used too, but, once your used to the touch controls, its a good game. I've played worms in the past and love the games, and this compared to it is like a 7 out of 10 stars.
A really great game. Just wish it had wifi multiplayer!
Only problem is screen goes black in between turns but its worms... gotta love it...
There is only one problem with this game : No Xperia PLAY support.
Its a grate game but should add more customization features
Awful. Freezes controls won't work. HTC vivid
But it actually runs smoothly. 4 stars because there's no original Russian sounds when switching languages. Worms Armageddon had them.
Much improved from previous release. Now works great on my EVO.
Awesome game but they should make it able to do multiplayer using wifi and stuff
I am not sure why people are having issues with this game.  My productivity just dropped to 0.  Thanks EA!  Jumping & Scrolling could be and should be updated.
Takes a couple rounds to really get the controls but after that its a great version of an awesome game . HTC Evo 4g
I used to play this all day on my NGage. Controls could use some work, otherwise it's a great game. No problems on the myTouch 4G slide.
Devs-- please release an update soon to fix buggy screen issues and also tablet support!  I love this game but I can't give it the 5 stars it deserves until some basic fixes are done.
Works great on my Droid 2 Global. No problems like I was afraid of after reading all the reviews.   Well worth the $2 for the memories or years past, and for current entertainment. Controls are ok, just takes some getting used to. As usual, I forgot you have to HOLD the fire button for when you shoot the homing missile, haha, my worm fell into the drink...  over all great game   Looking forward to a wifi, or if possible cell network Multiplayer.
Great gameplay, weapons, levels. Just needs buttons onscreen for movement and character/team creator.
Love it,  but need more weapons like Armageddon
Only downfall of the game is that it crashes too much and the weapons needs to get upgrated!!! Other than that its an awesome game to have!
Big fan of this game. First version i've played btw. The controls take a bit of getting used to but hang in there.. It's well worth the effort.
A fun game but I get the impression all of the effort went into making it look like the old pc game and the controls were an afterthought.
I like the port the controls can be wonky but its not that bad just requires some adjusting. It just needs a skirmish mode where you can set the teams
Classic worms.  Controls could be better
Although it's slightly hard to play on a 3" screen, it was smooth and funny as hell. Acer Liquid E on Rogers.
Good. Add online multiplayer and for some reason uninstalled itself on my droid bionic
Runs great on galaxy infuse 4g.....well worth a dollar
This game was great 13 years ago and it's awesome now. Buggy... Hopefully the devs will release an update. Also, I would pay more than a  dollar...
Works now on my HTC aria. Maneuvering the worms can be tricky but I think that just comes with practice.
Would be a lot better with HD gfx
Been a fan of this game for years. Controls not as bad as some reviews state. Download and enjoy some killin'.
Works really well on N1. Waiting for real multiplayer capabilities.
Runs great, and looks good. Only complaints are jumping and the lack of online multiplayer. Evo 3D
Works great on my nexus one. Brings back memories of worms armageddon.
Little bit wonky on the controls, but fun nonetheless.
Controls are a little shaky, but getting yourself killed is the point in worms. No online play sheds a star, but other than that It's great.
Poor control, and frequent crashes.
Looks great on HTC EVO . Controls are simple enough to learn quickly. I think it's a good value for a classic game with plenty of replay value

Used to be really good when it actually worked until update for my mytouch 4g. Don't download waste of money!! Can you fix this dev?...

Updated it and now is making me re download. Freezes when it shows that it is fully downloaded and won't work.
Now that the game is fixed, excellent work! Once you start getting into the 40+ challenges, they are really difficult!
5 stars if you get this game to work cross platform with iPhone users. IT CAN BE DONE
It works now! Good on ya! The controls are a little hard to get used to on a small touch screen but its still awesome!
Works great on Samsung Infuse 4G. Would prefer to have Worms 2 Armageddon instead of this, but it's better then nothing.
When I bought this it didn't work on my evo 4g. Finally an update fixed it. The controls take some getting used to but once you do it's excellent.
Works very well on my TMobile G2. Great game and controlls are well thought out for the most part.
Now the crash is fixed, and I can play it. Great game. I can't give full stars knowing they released with with a crash on boot and no fix for months

Doesn't work on HTC Sensation and their support either doesn't read the support tickets or doesn't care.
Cant get licence to work with my phone. Cant get a refund either. Its a shame.....they ruined a chance to put up competition for Angry Birds. WASTE
Piece of crap. Took 15+ min to download content and then doesn't even work on nexus one. And I can't refund, what a scam. BEWARE.
Don't download. After you buy and download this they ask you to download 40 more MB but that where it stops working
I must've given this a three star rating because It's my favorite game for the 360, but it doesn't work on my evo! EA, FIX THE GAME! Please!
FIX FOUND! copy ALL data from /sdcard/Android/data/com.ea.worms_NA_vzw/files/ to /sdcard/Android/data/com.ea.worms_na/files/ Confirmed on G2x.
I'd love this game, if it worked!!! is anyone going to fix this or what!?!
Running T-Mobile G2 - Android 2.2. The game will never succeed at downloading game data and will crash at "License Start".
That dam new update ruined worms fix it ASAP please better rating if it gets fixed HTC evo
That dam new update ruined worms fix it ASAP please better rating if it gets fixed HTC evo
You would think they would test this before posting it on the market. Epic Fail!
Latest update now supports multi-touch pan & zoom. Game is now fully playable again on my HTC Inspire! Awesome, but needs internet play for 5 stars.
Fixed some graphical glitches on my moto defy. Is fun but wish the controls were better
Fixed some graphical glitches on my moto defy. Is fun but wish the controls were better
crashes constantly when checking for license. emailed support and they give canned non-responses. no help at all. samsung galaxy s froyo.
Performs amazingly on Evo 4G This game is very well implement, the controls are easy to use and feel very natural. Feels quite nostalgic...

Gameplay is exactly as I expected for a Worms game (good thing). Multi-touch controls, multiplayer. Could run a bit smoother though.
Love Worms! Been playing since Armageddon in '98. Please make compatible w/ Samsung Tab!!

Sometimes force closes when I try to start it but normally works great on my motorola milestone. Had to drop gfx to low, fun game, needs online mp
Awesome, but you should be able to play other people online not just on your one phone.
I gave it 4 because i love worms. The touch screen controls are awful, wish i could use my keyboard, but looks and plays great. Epic 4g
FC issue is fixed for my Evo. Took a little while to get used to, but it's a pretty fun game.
Really not that fun. Huge post-purchase file download prevents refund, so thanks for that EA...really classy.
This app is actually really fun and addiciting it just takes a bit to get used to the controls. You cant just DL and start blowing worms up, you actually have to take 30 seconds and read the instructions. The controls do make sense once you get the hang of it. I have an EVO and it works fine and I play it all the time. I had to play at least 10 full matches before I figured it out and got the hang of it. These poor reviews are probably from people who dont like taking the time to figure games out.
It's definitely Worms... but it's just not that fun to me anymore. If you love the game, you'd probably enjoy this version for sure!
Fails on Nexus One with Gingerbread.
Runs well on my Samsung Galaxy S / Vibrant. Controls are intuitive and work well. Audio seems to have slight static sound when selecting weapons.
Nostalgic Worm-Kicking Action! Its so freaking cool to get to re-experience worms on my Android device! It's very true to the original PC game. However, user controls need improvement - especially the Ninja Rope. It's impossible to operate the Ninja Rope with the on-screen arrows as is. Also, I'd like to have the ability to turn off time limits in Quick Game mode.
Works great since update. Hard but fun. classic worms action on my phone. What's not to love! Nexus one 2.3.2 cm7

Works mostly fine on captivate. Game does freeze when phone sleeps. Need accent previews and ability to change round & turn timing
Force close on MT3GS.... Was really looking forward to this one :( Edit: still force closing, my touch 3g slide
Runs absolutely perfectly on my Nexus One with MIUI rom. Smooth and quick. Keep in mind it downloads extra 34mb to sdcard.
yay, it works, takes a bit of time to load on mytouch 4g, but gameplay is great

Great game. Only minor annoyance is that you can't use user created games in a standard match, just challenges.
After completely removing all traces of the software and reinstalled it works great. Awesome game
If it fails after "license start", delete the folder com.eamobile.worms and all its contents from sdcard/Android/data. Works well now on Epic 4G 2.1
Crash at license has been fixed. Still small issues however. Incredible game as long as it is not abandoned. rooted evo on cm7
Downloaded it once and it didn't work. Got a refund, then downloaded it again and now it works great.
Had to reinstall 3 times before this game would work. It's a rad game if you can get it working
works great in my Nexus One after an initial device not authorized error. just restarted and it worked
After deleting files on the sd card under the android folder, it forced it to re download in the game and everything works great now.
So far working well on samsung vibrant (froyo). Wish it had multiplayer over internet though

Doesn't work on nexus s appears to be trying to load iPhone controls according to logcat
Didn't work on my Evo. Tried clearing data AND rebooting phone. When a fix is released, I'll try again. But I'm not holding my breath. Not rooted.
Runs fine on nexus 1 using cm 7 alpha. Should have online multiplayer or at least wifi (LAN) multiplayer
Works great for me on nexus One 2.3 Would like to see phone to phone multiplayer!
Works great on my evo! Love this game. Although ninja rope is impossible to use with phone controls. Still great game!
It works for me just fine. The AI can be a little too crazy good at times. A fun game best with larger screens.
Cant put my phone down! Works great on Nexus S. Controls like multitouch zooming and panning around need a little work and no music.
Just because it doesnt work on your g2(miranda) or one type of other phone, doesnt mean it doesnt work at all. Its great on my g2.

Basically just scorched earth with worms instead of tanks. Nothing original, but still a cool game.
Force close HTC Evo. Uninstalling and waiting for later upgrade. 5 star game potential, but give 1 since I can not even use it.
Among the users that can't play. Hope this gets fixed soon. I've been a Worms fan forever!
I have a galaxy s phone by samsung. I downloaded this supposedly great game but fc as soon as I open - bummer! can you say "refund"?
Works on nexus one. Controls are a little awkward. Still a fun game. Could use work but still worth the price.
The best game since the PC veersion! GET IT TOTAL FUN will keep you entertained for hours!
Brings back good old memories. Great game, runs smooth, the only problem is screen shuts off but I can fix that myself in sound and display options
Love it, god this males me  so happy lol
I have played Worms forever on PS1 and my old HTC Evo.  Loaded it on my new Samsung Galaxy IIS, and it is certainly NOT running properly!  Please please fix this.  I need Worms back in my life.  I travel for work, and life just isnt worth living without my Worms working...
I love the worms series. This is no exception. Works great on my xperia play. A nice feature would be to assign keys to move so that its not all touchscreen.
Love this game 5 stars because I have the option to refund right away and it works great on galaxy s2
Played thus a long time ago... Good to see it again :)
Those people giving bad ratings sound like they've never played the game.  This game is awesome!  Plays great on my Thunderbolt.  One of the best Android games ever!  You just have to practice the controls.  I can say I have the classic game Worms on my phone and I can play it anywhere!  Thanks for making it a game for Android!
Blowing up fun
Overall great game, had zero problems downloading or installing. Would like to see multiplayer over internet or wifi. Controls are ok. AI seems to be hit or miss literally. Graphics are good, camera angle can be a tad annoying. Definately worth $2 in my book.
Controls are surprisingly not bad. Game didnt have as much contest as console/pc worms, but jesus it's only 2$ who cares, definitely worth it. Works perfect on my galaxy s. Ignore these people who cry it doesn't work on a small interface, it takes 5 minutes ryu get used to it
Sweet game it would be awesome if there were other worm games just like this like worms Armageddon & other worms world party games
Works great non the galaxy s3
I have been playing on the xoom without and issues.
Haven't been disapointed
Runs great and I love the game. Worth $2.07...
Nuff said.
Im playin just fine on a samsung dart so I dunno whats wrong with ur alls high end devices...
It runs fine on my asus transformer prime tf201. However controls could use a little improving and when i push the clock at the pause menu when i put it away i can't push resume, or any other button
Version 0.0.33 game is worth much more than the 2 dollars ... beware of incompatibility with any device or OS choice and configuration as always when you're an Android user
Now that I'm able to actually download it i love it. Everything you've come to expect from worms
See above
Works perfect on LG M +. Beautiful Graphics. Touch screen controls work as flawlessly as Worms is supposed to. Wifi multiplayer would be nice but my exp. too good not to give 5 stars. Worms for Android, YESSS!!!
Plays great on razr maxx! Controls are intuitive and work well.
THE BEST GAME EVER ...
No updates planned and it doesn't work on ice cream sandwich.
I used to love this game back in college,but its super buggy. Locks up on a Toshiba thrive after you do anything to the camera.
CORRECTION: WORKS GREATAFTER REBOOT Runs but you cant control the worms. Shoots when trying to walk then wont respond to anything. For example when you switch turns from computer to user it will no longer let you control, tap or shoot anything. Running on a sony tablet s with android 4.3 total waste of money. Bums me out I loved this game on pc.
Just like the pc a d console versions...worth every penny. Game is so fun and looks gret on my DROID X2.
Man I love this game have it on my xbox 360 as well as on my phone works great 5 stars
One of my favorite aracde games now for android!
Best game to past the time
Im using this game on the galaxy s2 tmobile and it works flawless. Never have i had a problem. It really is a fun game. First game i can say ea didnt mess up.
Game rocks on MyTouch 4GS
Considering that the latest version of this game came out in June 2011, I can understand the problems that make this game un-playable. EA needs to come out with an update. Worked on my Droid X, but functionality totally stopped when I upgraded to GNex. Fantastic game play and fun content, but EA is dropping the ball on updates. Read reviews and forums on compatibility before purchase.
Pretty cool game, just needs more team names
Just a great game all around, worth the money too, doesn't get boring!!
Perfect, works great.  Runs very well on my Evo 4g.
Takes a little getting used to controls, and sometimes can be a little touchy when scrolling left to right, but otherwise a perfect game. Thankyou for making an amazing mobile app!!!
I love it!
Love you.
No problems here, same old fun it's always been on every other platform I've played it. I love the exploding sheep!
Works flawlessly on my DROID X
I bought it for my Evo and tried playing it on my Galaxy Player but when I try to download I get an "Error:403 Failure to Download" message.
Works fine on my htc evo 4G.. takes a while to get use to the controls.. buy awesome classic game!
G
but it would be soooooo much better if u could play multi player via bluetooth or wifi!!!
Helps pass the time after my hip surgery. And its SOOO FUNNY
Nuff said.
I paid for this app and cant even open it!!! Very disappointed!
.
Works beautifully on my LG marquee only thing is it will occasionally force close but otherwise more,addicting than angry birds
Amazing, The only bad part is that it needs more gameplay. Otherwise its great. (I have an android 4G sidekick)
Awsome!!!
Great game and works well
Great game and works well
I've been staying away from this game for a while because of all the negative feedback. Figured I'd try it for myself and I'm happy I did. Works flawlessly on HTC evo 3d.  Very fun game
Works fine on nexus s running gingerbread. Love it
Love it!
Best game ever
Alright could be better
Works great. No lag. Jumping is easy (no clue why others are having difficulties double-tapping the screen). Way to go Team 17! Love this game!
Despite the 3 star rating.  This is one of the best renditions of this game.  I guess you need to have liked the others to appreciate it.
JUMPING SUCKS... JUMPING STILL SUCKS.
Doesn't work on my asus transformer -_____-
Game works perfectly on my SGS2 :)
On my htc inspire. Maybe stop blaming the game and pony up some real cash for a decent phone.
One of the greatest of childhood memories
Others must have too many apps running in the background i'm useing the lg optimus q and s no problems on thease weak phones
Takes a couple rounds to really get the controls but after that its a great version of an awesome game . HTC Evo 4g
Works perfectly on the HTC EVO.
So worth it.Love the whole series, great job. Lg Thrill
Fun game, and works great! I G2x / Vtab.
Had this for the N64 and this one is really fun. No issues at all on Samsung Infuse. Worth the few bucks!!!
Lots if fun. Good old worms
Old school relives love it!
Faulty multi touch controls need to close game, reopen and resume to fix it. Samsung galaxy nexus on ice cream sandwich
Love this game working perfectly on virgin mobile thruimph andriod 2.2.2. Wish there was online multiplayer though
Always a classic
Game is epic. I have no bugs on my HTC inspire.
Awesome game. ..no bugs yet
A great game brought back in excellent form. Works great in my incredible and hp touchpad. Well executed and thought out controls.
Good classic killing fun!
Works just like the old console version. The controls suck, but thats part of the Worms charm.
We need more games like this.
Works great on Galaxy S Captivate (with cyanogenmod 7.1). Some people complain about the controls, well..what do you expect out of a game designed for a mouse and keyboard.  Either way, once you get used to the controls, it is extremely fun.  Essentially  the game is almost as full featured as the originals.  I play it on the phone pretty much all the time.  The challenge mode is great. Each level getting more difficult than the last. Tip: Weapons help is in the PAUSE menu (had a hard time finding it)
Fun and old school!
Works great on nexus s. Doesn't work at all on Asus transformer.  Would be amazing on a tablet. More instruction for the artillery would help.

This is the best game ever made!  I'm so glad it's on the android market!
Controls take some getting used too, but good fun once you do.
Big fan of this game. First version i've played btw. The controls take a bit of getting used to but hang in there.. It's well worth the effort.
...Give this game some love. 16 bit classic well adapted to touch screen. Great on wide screen. HTC inspire... 1ghz or go home
This was always my favourite game love having it on my phone.  Worth every penny. 5 stars!!!
Awesome game, perfect! Works great (HTC Desire) - Be aware: Must download 40gb extra to SD to run.
Has the Holy Hand Gernade too! Idk what all those people are giving low scores on a great game!
Awesome!
Awesome!
Awesome
Won't download additional file which is evidently necessary for application to run. Took me too long to determine it was not a network error. Now I cannot get a refund.
Works great on bionic!
I never thought I could have worms on my phone!  And it works great on my nexus s.  Top notch Team 17 and EA. Way to go!
Had to d/l the files twice, but no prob after that.  Love the game, works great and no prob with the controls!
many are having issues wit the controls, they need to quit being lazy just like any game, you gotta figure it out. flawless Samsung captivate 2.2.1!
This game is pretty sweet I just  wish they had more weapons to choose from like super sheep
You Suck!
Awesome game waited a long time for this app. Hopefully will have a weapons expansion pack or upgrade.
Only downloads the 34MB once. And quit crying about controls, use a little bit of your brains and learn them. Works great! Droid3. Thanks!
Runs very smooth on Samsung infuse!
Just like old times. Dig it
I dont know why people are saying its bad, this is a great port of a game. Fast, great graphics, the only problem I have is screen sleep all the time.
I'm on level 45 &  I still adore it.
Thunderbolt works great but wtf is wrong with it when I download it to my xoom... Fix asap... Yall messing up a great game
one of my old favourite computer games now on my phone what more can i ask for.
Just like worms open warfare 2, needs a canpaign.  NOTE new worms game for xbox 360, just like worms 3d
Memory issue makes the game force close love the game but need more weapons like the older pc version my touch .4g
Runs great on my HTC desire hd. Great game and lots of fun. Worth the 1$
This game was great 13 years ago and it's awesome now. Buggy... Hopefully the devs will release an update. Also, I would pay more than a  dollar...
If u like to nlow things up  Get this game
Good game Need game style setting
Works great! - At&t sony ericsson xperia x10 with forced official gingerbread (2.3.4)
Worms is working now...thanks Team 17...THIS IS A GREAT GAME...may take a bit more training than you are used to, but more than a glorified slingshot.
Needed to move game to phone to work on Epic touch. Automatically installs to sd card and won't work when on sd card.  Awesome game. Easy controls
Too good to believe. My favourite classic game on the phone. Controls surprisingly good for touch screen. runs well on galaxy s (telus).
Would be a lot better with HD gfx
love it... loved it on ps also...
Nice graphics and smooth game play. Photon 4g
Little bit wonky on the controls, but fun nonetheless.

Still bugs HTC sensation. Keeps deleting itself from my app list. Have to keep installing every few days
Poor control, and frequent crashes.
Looks great on HTC EVO . Controls are simple enough to learn quickly. I think it's a good value for a classic game with plenty of replay value
Finally started seeing good reviews for this game and now it tells me this game is not authorized for use on my device. HTC Aria

Updated it and now is making me re download. Freezes when it shows that it is fully downloaded and won't work.
Now that the game is fixed, excellent work! Once you start getting into the 40+ challenges, they are really difficult!

Worked before, won't work anymore. Edit: search comments for camerons fix. It works. EA still sucks for not fixing it themselves.
EA fails yet again. Can purchase for Evo 3D, but tells you it's incompatible. Tell your programmers that the apk manifest is there for a reason.
Had to copy a file in there to a second location. Google it. Awesome game
After three weeks ea games finally put out an update and it works just fine on my G2. Very happy
When I bought this it didn't work on my evo 4g. Finally an update fixed it. The controls take some getting used to but once you do it's excellent.
I love this! Works perfectly on evo 4g after the update. Great game, reminds me of my younger days :)
Got a new EVO 3d and this says my device isn't supported...even after July '11 update. Wth Ea.

5 stars but only after latest update, before then it force closed on my EVO shift. But now works just fine! Exactly like the old computer version
Doesn't work on HTC Sensation and their support either doesn't read the support tickets or doesn't care.
Does not work for Sidekick 4G please fix this. Very dissapointed. This one of my favorite games
Carefully read inductions for installing. I had some issues with it freezing while downloading but after a few tries and some patience it works great!
Fix works perfectly on HTC EVO, still maintaining one star rating because EA won't fix the game itself.
Does not work. My touch 4g says checking for licenses and then closes. Don't lose your money.
Wont open on g2x, worked great when I had my mytouch 4g but now won't for g2x
Cameron's fix worked for me...woohoo! copy ALL data from /sdcard/Android/data/com.ea.worms_NA_vzw/files/ to /sdcard/Android/data/com.ea.worms_na/files/ Confirmed on Nexus S
Your phones must not be up to par.works 100% fine on my instinct, and this is the bottom of the line android phones. Try installing flash
Was working fine, then an update and now it either won't start or says unauthorized for your android. HTC mytouch 4g
Wont dowload 40 mb data file on mytouch 4g. And I really wanted some worms on the go. EA, you can have my money back when you fix this game.
This is great, but sadly this licensed version is not working for my phone, MT3G slide, though the pirated one does. Please, get things together, EA..
Its cool and fun and also very easy to do I like it a lot worms is asome
With samsung epic game is flawless and tons of fun. I think other reviewers just have phones withouta fast enough processor.
I love worms... what the f#€%. Force close on licensing, htc g2. Uninstalled no more than 10 min after puchase n no refund option... FIX THE GAME NAO!
Evo. Used to work, now just shows license start then crashes. Even after reinstall....
Run the Game it updated then said Start Licence and exits..Captivate Galaxy S...crap port to android. and cant refund now after waiting for the update i forgot to play in the first 15 mins so im stuck with it..
App won't install on my EVO 4G unless the SD card is unmounted, but even after install and remount SD card, app force closes shortly after opening.
Love it. If you are having trouble, unistall and reinstall. But when it's downloading don't touch anything!
LOVE! Best game on Android, hands down. Lacking tutorial on use of all weapons is my only complaint. Worth every penny!

Same game I played 10 years ago on pc!! Sweet! Works perfectly on samsung epic 4g
Loved the game on the computer...was so excited didnt read galaxy not supported... wont play on epic...
HTC aria. Pay for app and won't open. Force close. Please fix, I love this game and want to play.
Awesome game that I played many years ago on the pc. A faithful reproduction which effectively takes care of the different control systems.
Purchased the game and was immediately told that it wasn't licensed for my device. Now I can't get a refund!
There is NO reason to give this game a bad rating!!! unless you have a crappy phone. So DON'T blame the game for your cheap phone.. lol... 5 stars
This game is awesome and runs well on powerful phones. If your phone phone sucks dont blame the app Galaxy s 4G
Doesn't work... on 3g slide lame i really love this game 2 sucks if u have a slide don't bother i just got reied off i bout the game and it doesn't wk
Great game if you can get it working. Tips, you have to download additional content by 3g. Wi fi dont work. If you downloaded via wifi, uninstall game
Awesome, but you should be able to play other people online not just on your one phone.
I don't know why the rating is so low. This is the best game on Android. Runs perfect and just like the old worms games. Evo

Doesn't work on my Samsung Moment. This needs to be fixed asap. I've been waiting for this game forever, now its here and force closes.
Goes to title screen says liscense start then closes, not happy :( (samsung galaxy s epic)
This game is excellent after the most recent update. It runs smoothly on my HTC EVO 4G. Controls work well, but it takes time to adjust.

Force close on MT3GS.... Was really looking forward to this one :( Edit: still force closing, my touch 3g slide
Runs absolutely perfectly on my Nexus One with MIUI rom. Smooth and quick. Keep in mind it downloads extra 34mb to sdcard.

If it fails after "license start", delete the folder com.eamobile.worms and all its contents from sdcard/Android/data. Works well now on Epic 4G 2.1
Downloaded it once and it didn't work. Got a refund, then downloaded it again and now it works great.
works great in my Nexus One after an initial device not authorized error. just restarted and it worked
After deleting files on the sd card under the android folder, it forced it to re download in the game and everything works great now.

After deleting the downloaded data and downloading it again things are working great
Really good game just do the deleting step off one of the comments, games great controls are designed well I love worms!
So far working well on samsung vibrant (froyo). Wish it had multiplayer over internet though
Some game data downloads fail. Just delete the bad game data in sd\android\data\com.ea.worms_NA and run it again to redownload.
Sucks!!! Doesnt even start fix this problem quick if I could give it 0 stars I would
Forecloses,How can the iPhone4 run this and my evo cannot? Horrible! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!
Force closes for captivate :-(... and I play this all the time on my PlayStation
Force Closes before it even opens. EA better come out with an update that fixes this soon.
Works fine on my G2 rooted CM7 not sure what issues people are having but it runs great

People are right! U suck EA & U are NO better than a Common Thief! U always come out w/ games that dont work &then charge us' $3 Samsung Vibrant
Works perfect on my vibrant 2.2 team wiskey rom. Dled the 40 meg over wifi.
Downloaded it, installed all of the extra crap and then the game would not start up. What a bunch of crap total waste of cash and Icant get my money
Works lovely on my Vibrant. Nice graphics and fluid gameplay. Not sure why people are having problems.
Cant put my phone down! Works great on Nexus S. Controls like multitouch zooming and panning around need a little work and no music.
This app doesnt work on the samsung intercept it just goes back to the home screen i was so excite cause its worms but dont waste ur money
Works fine on my hd2 buy the controls are iffy and I have to hit things multiple times
nice game, though I am still trying to figure out exactly how to play it! (nexus one)

Just because it doesnt work on your g2(miranda) or one type of other phone, doesnt mean it doesnt work at all. Its great on my g2.
Not sure why so many people are having problems with the game. Works great on my evo! It's a must have for any die hard worms fans.
Love it, with update I have music now! Im running on samsung vibrant 2.2 no problems
Been waiting for this on Android since I jumped ship on my iPhone! Runs kinda crappy on my G2. Hope this improves. Wifi multiplayer would be nice!
Love this game. Multitouch controls could be better but overall quite fun, just like the old desktop versions.
Didn't want to launch on my Evo and I tried multiple times even after hard reset. Got a refund.
G2 works well. Reload it and download the 28mb app to play. Don't give up.
App closes after license says start. EA Needs to fix, it's a killer game. I wanted for free since EA didn't tested. - Nexus S -

I don't know what everyones problem is but this game runs great on my vibrant. Great voices. Beautiful graphics. My fave game by a longshot.
Had to uninstall, license issue, then reinstall using 3g instead of wifi, works great, love it. Epic 4G

Works on nexus one. Controls are a little awkward. Still a fun game. Could use work but still worth the price.

Its okay. Some minor bugs here and there, including sound popping. Very disappointed "multiplayer" doesn't mean with actual people...5 stars if so.
Force closes everytime on my HTC Desire. Too bad, I've loved worms since my PS 1 days.
If u like worms its a must have! Controls need a bit help but playabel
The best game since the PC veersion! GET IT TOTAL FUN will keep you entertained for hours!
Brings back good old memories. Great game, runs smooth, the only problem is screen shuts off but I can fix that myself in sound and display options

Ignore my prev post. Restart app after data DL! THEN it worked beautifully on my Captivate running 2.1! Thank you for bringing back an old favorite.
15 min refund is a little dumb. It is taking longer then that for the update. So basically expect no refund

Works flawless on nexus S I was so happy to find it.* Philip how is $3 for a quality game too much and 40mb goes to your SD card not internal storage
