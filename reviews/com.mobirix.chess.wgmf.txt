Not very accurate when there are delays. Still shows my flight departing at 830. It is 10:00
How can u make a chess game with out the stalemate rules?? I would rate this 4-5 star but not with the stalemate problem!!
This app has the potential to be awesome. But, as of now, there are too many problems. For one, there is no stalemate. Not after 3 fold repetition. Not after 50 moves without a pawn move, or a capture. There is no stalemate period!? Also, the way the games are timed is a gyp. Your opponent can't lose on time. But, you will if you don't win in under 15 minutes. Finally, you have to play as black almost every game in tournament mode. This is chess with rules that are senseless and unfair.
