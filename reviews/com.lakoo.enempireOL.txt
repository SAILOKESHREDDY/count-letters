Looks good but the screen is offset so i cant really see whats going on to well. Kind of annoyed. Back to TWOM
Looks fun bit on the DROID RAZR the screen is off to the bottom right and i can't see anything or read anything. Very disappointed for such a highly rated game to fail so hard. Please fix this.
Just isnt that good..graphics sucked, mods sucked, fight pattern sucked etc
Great game
Ima like crying every 5 min it force close
Epic azz game
Separately government dictionary
Fucked up
The game has gone weird it dosont always load all map parts and it semes to easy then it used to be when iplayed on my phone
No 3D effect. Stupid and difficult controlls. Worst mmorpg I've seen to date. Order and chaos is the only true fun mmorpg. This game has horrible graphics and stupid gameplay. If your a true gamer you will pry hate this game
Whatever I choose, I just get some random character.
Playing on Sony tablet. A lot of fun.
Every time I try to open it; it force closes.
Thor Suit.
I haven't even finished tutorial
Would help if i could actually get on the game but no force close i give up dont download unless u want force close
Great game
Umm, my character was either deleted or was completely changed. I made a Nordic Wizard, I come back its a Nordic Warrior Chick....was always some other char. but mines lol.
This game is bs, won't let me customize anything, even after the tutorial. It just randomly spits me out with everything chosen for me.
Force closes on my Samsung intercept
I have played this game now for a year. I cannot play it on my Droid razor because of the screen length. I have a level 53 character and can't play now. Very upset
Everytime I try to play it nevere works I stops everytime I try ro login I would give it 5 stars intill its fixed
Zip notifications. No thank you
Installs malware/spyware.   Poor graphics.  Not worth downloading.
The GM's don't care for players I've submitted several tickets askin for help with bugged quests and they refuse to help. 1/5
I have played EO for many months and since maintenance last night the game said it is still in server maintenance and will not let me log in, will rate 5 stars when this problem is fixed because this game does deserve a 5 star rating... Milestone X
This may be just for Acer users but the game was horrible. The character I created never ended up being the character I went into the game with. Like choosing a image then starting as a warrior for so,e reason. Totally buggy.
But the game doesn't fit on my phone's screen. I didn't get to choose my character either. This game has potential, if the bugs are fixed.
Has good features but is in IPAD mode can anyone fix this??
Looks kind of cool, nice 16-bit graphical effect but took ages to actually make a character because it wouldn't let me save it (kept chucking me into the game with a character I didn't create) and to top it off, it kept force closing on my Xperia Mini Pro. Shame, really, it looked decent.
Cant playing with galaxy tab 10 Because the screen too small
The screen was off center and couldnt continue the tutorial. Droid razr
Ok game at beginning. Followed quests but had to google how to revive pet, where to fix broken eq, went to different city and found NPC selling eq but not related to my job and can't fix my eq.
Why is my screen so small..
Really fun game, but the second I closed it, it deleted my character. I was already lvl 12 too...
It's not bad. Need more time to decide though.
The resolution wont fit my screen..droid razr maxx
Not bad...
boring
Hi
Yay
xperia play all the time forecloses. very good game though
Fun colorful and whimsical.  Definately enjoying this title.
I don't know if its me or my phone, but when I go to make a character the class and name I pick get totally randomized at the end result and I end up with a random class with a visitor name. I go to change the name to what I previously used and it says it already been taken...
Lke
Pretty col
They made me.
Cool game keeps up the good work
.
It a pretty good game
Back to old days rpg
Yo
Good time killer with plenty of customization. Kudos
Fix the crashes and your gold.
Not great. Just good
Needs work, ill rate 5 stars when perfected. Glitches everywhere, and the writing is horrible.  Feels very unfinished.
Linear but a fun way to get through the day.
Good rpg
I don't know really whats going on, but I cant chat or figure it out. I can write the texts but don't know how to send. Am I just being dumb?
Its alright I just started and I think it needs more character choices
It is great, graphics, gameplay, and everything. But they forgot to mention that it's simple gaming. Touch here, tap there. It's like a browser game but with more animation. Other than the simplistic gaming controls, it is quite good.
fun fun fun
Vguijjb
Pretty fun so far!
nice way to past time.:)
Hell yeah now its fix
Good game but trouble getting character I wanted didn't give me what asked for several times in a row other than that no complaints
I'm a little lost. I'm not sure if its a translation thing,but other that, you've got my attention
Fun game all
Nice
Not too shabby.. :)
Thor suit

Auto-travel is the best improvement.
So far its an awesome game the quick travel is an amazing tool 4 quick lvl ups but y don't u have a gender choice at the beginning of the game its a lil annoying............should also b able 2 choose ur class

Love it lots things to do
Overall is a great game, I've been playing it for 2 days and cant get over the lack of info after you take quest. There are some minor bugs with the npc's dialogs (overlapping on top of each other). I would like to see a professional review about this game. Btw the game makes you buy stuff with money for quests. To wrap the things up , I would say that is a good game for a free to play one.
A have to play MMO!
Its a good little free rpg but you do get kicked off alot
I was forced.
This game is fun and the graphics are great
Great game
Idk why a turn mmo hasn't been made before... incredible.

Yay
This right here is my swag
This is by far my favorite mmorpg for the phone! Its not yet perfected, but I like that they update often to fix any bugs and add new things. I'm not a fan of their money system. Its very expensive and idiotic that one has to purchase things that should automatically come with your character such as storage space. Besides that tho, I'm definately going to be playing this for a long time!
Love this game
Best mmorpg ive ever played

I played this on iOS, and since then it's got better. I tried to enjoy it before, but it had a major problem, which has since been fixed. I have chat turned off, but look out for Angel@>. Also look out for my empire, Aranesta. It needs contributions, which I'm unable to provide at the moment.
Fun game
Can't stop playing. It has a decent player base.
