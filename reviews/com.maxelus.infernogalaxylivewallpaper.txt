Beautiful live wallpaper. I actually use this (and other ones created by this dev) on a daily basis. Runs great. Droid X
i have lag on my SGS3 after installing this LW.
Don't download if your looking for something exciting. This is hands down one of the most BORING wallpapers I've ever installed!!! Do.Not.Get.
It would look so much better if there were no debris field. Please offer a setting to turn debris on or off. Thanks.
Used on nexus s and evo 3d. Makes home screens very very glitchy. And same goes for all of developers apps. Beautiful and nice just needs work
I like it.Its super awesome.
I usually dont like using live wallpapers, but this is one of the few that doesn't consume your battery as bad as the other ones our there. get this 1
Very good, phone actually lags less for some reason, could just be luck though - HTC legend
I can't say its just simple...surely its awesome than anyother...want some more live wallpaper like this....

Works for a few seconds, then freezes.
Wow, totally surprised by this one! It looks so good that I get goosebumps when I look at my ohone and find myself getting lost in the details
Awesome! By far the best free live wallpaper out there, apart from ice & shadow galaxy!
It always asks for force close. Can some one tell me if it works on android 2.1
Beautiful, but repetition gets old after a while. And it goes to black too often
Wow! Graphics are spectacular! Works great on atrix. Haven't tested battery life with this yet
VIEW MORE APPS from this dev!! All the live walls works flawlessly on my DroidX, and are very clean, and NO permissions!! Excellent work! Thank you!

Wow, totally surprised by this one! It looks so good that I get goosebumps when I look at my ohone and find myself getting lost in the details
The black dots ruin what would otherwise be an awesome live wallpaper. Uninstalling.
Would be 5 stars, but the black chunks RUIN this otherwise gorgeous work of art for me. Please update, or make a v.2 without them.
....but the performance is really bad

Has a great 3D look too it. Makes everything stand out nicely on the screen.
It runs great until it freezes up. And it freezes a lot. I have to reboot my phone several times a day to keep it live. HTC inspire 4G.
Looks great but it freezes all the time and stays frozen until I restart phone. HTC EVO Shift

Beautiful. Reminds me of the system where Aegis VII is-- or should I say was... Dead Space fans know what I'm talking about.
This is the best wallpaper I have so far. Galaxy S User.
I'm a big sci fi / space fan, I also blow air into space, and love this wallpaper!
Best lwp. But drains battery like nything n kinda eats up resources. Dnt use it if u r gnna b far from urcharger fr long :-)
This wallpaper blows me away! It feels very 3d and when I first opened it up, I said "Woah!" Must have. Droid x
Good...... App....
not god.
Causes the phone to slow when moving between pages.
Nice visual, but causes my menus to lag a little when flipping between panels. Uninstalling.
...puts a shortcut on my homescreen
This is a really cool live wallpaper.I like it.Thanks and great job.

Was better before the update, gave five stars but now changed to three as not as colourfull
Kinda lame, shows same thing over and over again, sorry, pretty colorful i guess. Uninstalling
Flickers when you turn on lock screen and close apps. Beautiful wallpaper, if flashing fixed, I will use. Otherwise no. EVO 3D

Cool lwp but flickers once when going back to home screen after last update on my atrix
Thunderbolt. My favorite live wallpaper. Everyone who sees it looks at my phone in awe
I love all four of your wallpapers! Keep up the good work! Evo 4g decks rom 2.3.4
It cycles through once then freezes. I'm guessing it's a problem isolated to htc g2 phones based on the comments. Interesting wallpaper besides that
ATTN DEV. Would look much better if remove some of the black moving "rocks" moving in front. Looks out of place. VERY SMOOTH ON GALAXY S!! RUNS PERF!!
Extremely laggy. Caused home screen to slow down tremendously. Very good design, just not very optimized.
Amazing wallpaper ... ... works flawlessly
Worked for most of the day then it froze up. Fix please! Otherwise it's cool.
It is beautiful but it completely freezes a lot and the only way to fix it is to reset your wallpaper...please fix this!
Looks fantastic however ocasionally freezes my Infuse 4g and have to reset as wall after reboot. Not bad on battery though.
I can't say its just simple...surely its awesome than anyother...want some more live wallpaper like this....

I never, EVER make app reviews, but this is incredible (along with all of your other wallpapers). I could watch it all day.
Awesome! By far the best free live wallpaper out there, apart from ice & shadow galaxy!
Great graphics, but poor performance, its like it plays through live motion once, then becomes static and a stationary :( please fix!

This is my fav, no noticeable issues at all. Love the detail on this...HTC Thunderbolt. Well done!
Not a fan of fad in and out, prefer drift of vortex and shadow. Good work though!
Very beautiful on my Thunderbolt, amazing! Just freezes, 3 stars til fixed. Other than that, best wallpaper out there!
I have actually received compliments on this background. I love it. It is very clear. I haven't had any battery issues.
Looks like my phone should be hotter, based purely on these graphics! Love it! Realistic, beautiful, and a favorite! Good job on this!

Worked perfect on my tbolt until the last update. Now it freezes after a half day. 3 stars until that's fixed
What I said for the Shadow Galaxy app applies here as well: Can I get this as a Windows or Mac desktop or screensaver? I love it so much! I didn't think I would be into the whole live wallpaper thing Android has going for it, but I really like both the Shadow Galaxy and the Inferno Galaxy. I switch between the two. Runs well on my Nexus S. No problems so far. Thank you!
It runs great until it freezes up. And it freezes a lot. I have to reboot my phone several times a day to keep it live. HTC inspire 4G.
Wow! This looks insane! Just please try and optimize it more as it's a fair bit laggy on my N1 with 2.3.3

Very nice, bur freezes after a while (desire hd). Same for the other galaxy wallpaper
This is way too heavy for the Droid 1. Frame rate is something like 10-15 per second. Other than that, looks amazing!
ALWAYS freezes multiple times a day. Please fix and I'll rate five stars. It would be my favorite if it didn't freeze.. Stock MT4G.
Freezes a lot...like I open Handcent and go back to the home screen and the wallpaper would freeze. - Rooted Inspire 4G
Beautiful wallpapers, but 10 min in, phone started vibrating in pulses and crashed. I reassigned the wallpaper to the phone and it did the same thing.
Amazing.....i'm shocked that such a Gorgeous wallpaper doesn't drain down my battery!!!

Absolutely beautiful wallpaper but my phone has frozen up last two times I've had it running. Too bad. samsung fascinate
It always stops moving on my phone. It looks amazing when it does move but its.always freezing in the back ground.

While the visuals and animation are extremely impressive, the live wallpaper results in reduced performance switching screens, loading the applications menu, and launching applications on the Motorola Xoom running stock Honeycomb 3.0.1
BEAUTIFUL! IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, PLEASE KEEP YOUR NASTY COMMENTS TO YOURSELVES!!! ...Desire
It slightly lags when I scroll on my home screen on my Galaxy nexus running jelly bean. Please fix and other than that it is great.
It great...Look pretty cool
Hanging in galaxy ace 5830i
Cute
Amazing look, seems to stick slightly when moving between wallpapers on my HTC one x
I like the firey look and directin of the asteroids. It is real neat.
Amazing animation
No anything bundled, just great live wallace.
It seems to operate ok. I haven't noticed any real problems with it. It's not that impressive though. I do wonder if folks realize that in  vacuum, oxygen depleted space there isn't any flame when something explodes. O well. I'm wondering if Jonathon just learned how to spell TOOL. If someone's opinion isn't to your liking doesn't make them a TOOL. It just means their likes are different than yours. Give it a break, JONATHAN.
The wallpaper is very smooth and required no permissions, which seems to be very rare nowadays. There are no nagging prompts to download software or anything of that nature. I absolutely love this wallpaper, and the others by this author.
Awesome live wallpaper
just downloaded I hope will not affect battery as live wallpaper.
It looks really cool Just needs more red   Also needs improvement to not use alot of Memory.  Good wallpaper give it A Download :)  HTC Droid Incredible
It's all a bit moody
It sometimes makes my.screen move to slow. Other wise its good. Lg optimus m

This is one of the best looking live wallpapers out there imo, it gets 4/5 for lack of customisation options though.
Nice looking galaxy.
Uses to much of my battery but love it!
Its very realistic and good to look at, but it does use a lot of battery power.

Can we have another option at 65 -75 % to save more battery? Thanks in advance.

Looks amazing! My favorite wallpaper! Does lower the battery life though on HTC Evo Shift.
I'm a major scifi geek, and this totally tickles my imagination.
I love this wallpaper. It looks absolutely gorgeous on my Samsung Infuse. But it changes back to the previous wallpaper after reboot! Any ideas?
Love it.
buuurn.. good lookin. I've recently installed in my inspire 4G, but too much for my old milestone overclocked at 1000MHz
A few times it freezes for a moment, then it resets itself and its good for the rest of the day
Got all 4 galaxy wallpapers and they look amazing. It would be cool if all 4 came together in 1 app. Nexus S.

The most beautiful suite of wallpapers in the store, amd the artist has released them for free! Truely, a great person. Galaxy S. 5 stars.
Looks great and runs well on my X2. I like how it has the debris floating in front of the cloud.
I love all four of your wallpapers! Keep up the good work! Evo 4g decks rom 2.3.4
It cycles through once then freezes. I'm guessing it's a problem isolated to htc g2 phones based on the comments. Interesting wallpaper besides that

Visually beautiful app. 4/5 only because it freezes about 5 times a day and has to be restarted. Hope they can fix.
Great wallpaper but for some reason crashes once in a while on my experia play phone. Hope you could fix it. Cheers!

I agree with Phil. Can we PLEASE do something about the jerky motion? It IS distracting from the Beauty of the Artwork.
No settings, non-interactive. Love the lack of permissions required. Slightly laggy on X10i 2.1. Takes up 25MB of memory.
Great visuals. Looks amazing on Desire and Galaxy tab, although slightly laggy on the tab; looks like 24.5 fps.
It always asks for force close. Can some one tell me if it works on android 2.1

So close to perfect, but does create the slightest bit of lag on my Droid Incredible. Far from unusable, but any lag just drives me nuts.

Really good - graphics are beautiful. Can be choppy at times n slow down other apps or just the phone period (minor). Drains the battery a bit
Beautiful. Cleared some icons from one of my home screens just to let this run unobstructed
Beautiful wallpapers, but 10 min in, phone started vibrating in pulses and crashed. I reassigned the wallpaper to the phone and it did the same thing.

I've been looking for a wallpaper that is both beautiful and masculine at the same time. This is it for me. Its not overly active in the background and runs smoothly on my galaxy nexus
Details are so great...
Cool! Now I got the Ice Galaxy, Shadow Galaxy and this Inferno Galaxy.
I have used this background and only this background for the whole time I have had this phone.
Beautiful! Soo real i love it

Kool app..
5 star for you.. keep up the good work. thumbs up
These backgrounds are unbelieveable! Beside great looks, my phone works fine with animation. It's a shame my Xperia x10i has a weak battery :(

Works great looks good on my galaxy note massive 5.3 inch screen.
This is Badass!
Thank you for a quality app, freedom from ads, and dedication and persistence in updates. You are the developer all others should look to for advice. And the walls are beautiful.
You should make more LWP's similar to this.
The wallpaper is very smooth and required no permissions, which seems to be very rare nowadays. There are no nagging prompts to download software or anything of that nature. I absolutely love this wallpaper, and the others by this author.

What more can I say? It may constantly drain your phone's battery more than other wallpapers, but when you've got something as cool (or should I say hot) as this, who cares?? This is hands down THE BEST.
Brilliant!!!

I have had all the live wallpapers out there. The quality ones really look good on my Samsung Galaxy S SAMOLED displays. These live wallpapers look fantastic on my SGS Vibrant, SGS 4G and my Acer Iconia tablet. People that see these on my 10.1" tablet ALL comment and compliment. And I can see iPad owners in Starbucks sneaking looks when I prop my tablet up on its cover. Those giving this 1-3 stars, you are lame, as indicated by there the 5,000 4-5 stars vs. your 500 total giving these 1 to 3 stars.

What I said for the Shadow Galaxy app applies here as well: Can I get this as a Windows or Mac desktop or screensaver? I love it so much! I didn't think I would be into the whole live wallpaper thing Android has going for it, but I really like both the Shadow Galaxy and the Inferno Galaxy. I switch between the two. Runs well on my Nexus S. No problems so far. Thank you!

It runs great until it freezes up. And it freezes a lot. I have to reboot my phone several times a day to keep it live. HTC inspire 4G.

Wow! This looks insane! Just please try and optimize it more as it's a fair bit laggy on my N1 with 2.3.3
This is a fairly awesome wallpaper. After trying about 50 this is the one I've settled on.

Lots of comments about freezing; hasn't happened to me after days of use. Looks great and doesn't seem to tax my Motorola Bravo much.
Beautiful wallpapers, but 10 min in, phone started vibrating in pulses and crashed. I reassigned the wallpaper to the phone and it did the same thing.
My real name is elvis olmedo its on my birth card but eny way its ASOME and cool i havent sean nothing like it yet intill now.

While the visuals and animation are extremely impressive, the live wallpaper results in reduced performance switching screens, loading the applications menu, and launching applications on the Motorola Xoom running stock Honeycomb 3.0.1
Can't stop looking at it it's mesmerizing. Gorgeous wallpaper!
