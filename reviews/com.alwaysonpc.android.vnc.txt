Horribly slow and froze constantly. I am waiting for my refund. I'm HIGHLY disappointed.
This app is permanently frozen at the home Page. It doesn't work. It's a complete rip off, don't buy!
Bs app do not buy
I paid $19.99 for this app, and it has not done ANYTHING for me and now you say I need to update AND PAY ADDITIONAL MONEY???  Sorry friend, I would like you to refund my $19.99, or I will dispute this with my credit card company. It sounded like just what I needed, but, it was good for nothing except taking up space. I look forward to my refund.  Thank you.  Catherine Kleven
Why do I always have to uninstall and wait Two days to reinstall this app works great if it was FREE!!! I want my 20 bucks back
Was working decently, but kept disconnecting, once lasted for 5 min but once only 1 min. Not worth the hassle of continually reconnecting.
I have a few problems with this app. 1st, on my (global/international) g nexus the menu button does nothing. 2nd, after about 10-15 min of running the app the screen goes black and all you can see is buttons and mouse. I love the app and I'm happy to support it. Please fix. Also speed improvements for java would be nice.
It keeps closing on me.It so sucks
You said only one time you would have to pay you lied  I will report you!!!!! as spam. Don't buy dev got greedy. 0!!!! stars!!!!! Your rotation also doest work!
everything that i can do on this i could already do.exept runescape which is SOOOOOOOOOOO lagy.and i think €20 is way overpriced it should be around €5.i would get my money back but i cant so...i dont recommend this to ANYONE.no wonder over 25% of ppl rated 1 star...
Doesn't work on rooted gingerbread, if anyone has a fix let me know. Just keeps connecting when u try and connect to server, Waste of $20

Angry Birds is one of the few descent apps on here Flash is Choppy Not Smooth streaming, No Sound Still after all this time?! And I haven't seen an update in almost a Whole Year, come on Dev Throw Us a Bone for The $20.
Doest work like it supposed to. It freezes up then crashes. Doesn't run Java either. For $20.00 it should work with no problems .
I gave this app one star only because it opens. If I was to imagine what kind of computer this app ran on by speed it would probably be a Commodore 64. It takes to long to load sites. Add it up, price of app plus price of Motrin for the head ache it causes. Point blank, NOT worth it!

Could be good, but it crashes all the time. Don't waste your money until they fix the bugs
The one program I needed this for will not work because always on pc will not pull up keyboard to let me logon. It was a waste of $.
Rather of had a fix,WILL $again so SINCERELY hope the best 4them!Can b amazing app4 ALL when they figure it out, worth it 10fold 2them when they do!
Wow, its like getting the power of a desktop computer on a phone. Full chrome browser that is blazing fast. Full word/excel/presentation editing. Works perfectly on tmonbile galaxy s2.
Developer please fix or refund. Real great app but need this fix quickly.
Its great, the only thing it needs is the abiltiy to watch streaming video. And install programs. Then it will be the best app ever. S Galaxy Indulge
Un-fing-believeable! This is hands down THE BEST app. This just opens so many doors! Awesome!
Ive paid for it but it says that I haven't got a licence. I really wanted this App too!
I use to love this app. I can't play my facebook game anymore (cafeworld). What happened? I want to play my game again!!!!
Downloaded said i purchased but then woudn't install. Refunded. -droid incredible
Launches every time, but then decides that it deosn't want to continue working after a little while and throws up error messages inviting me to force stop. (Sony Ericsson Experia Play Android 2.3). Great idea if and when it can be made to work.
Can't use my screen keyboard at all on the galaxy tab, pretty useless without it. Kb pops up, but no input is passed to the desktop
Nice app!Can open tiff files.Can improve but is still the best app that I have seen.I love it!--Stan watts 03/5/11

Useless developer does not answer email. Unable to browse files on sd card. Unable to get refund. Moto Droid.
Its 19 dollars which i will never forget it. I lost my money for nothing.
It doesn't let me to log in. Help!
Don't waste your money on something that isn't even worth it..
Due to the server being about -8 GMT... Which isn't mentioned in the app description.. The latency is terrible in the UK meaning it's practically useless. Wanting to play runescape? Sure you can log in but try and move and the thing lags out or force closes! What a joke...
I use this to play runescape and runescape private servers. Kinda slow, but alright. F√cking g√y that its trying to get me to pay again. I say good fight I figured out how to hack in.
this application is way to over priced does not run good at all use to about a year ago not now do not even support flash but yet want you to pay $20.00 dollars for it go ahead and buy you will be disappointed take my word for it.
Not reliable by any means
Trying to get on java and it says controller socket unable to locate port in range 6510-65163.. Please help
Everything works great on my droid x2 except I cant type anything anywhere, the keyboard will come up but I cant enter in a website or login! :(
For those having problems with the keyboard on a mobile device, try turning off predictive text and see if it works.

I tried it on samsung moment. While a good idea, too slow to load and execute commands to be useful. Also, moment lacks needed multi touch support.
After about 15 mins, the screen just cuts to black and the mouse pointer. Please fix this issue, its very annoying and holding your product back from being alot better.

Amazing that this actually works. However, it is overpriced. It is also remarkably slow for my purposes. Speed it up=5 stars
Is it worth $20? Sure, if you have cash to burn. If you're like me, you want more from your phone. You could use a computer,  but your phone is more convenient. This app comes along as a middleman. It gives you the stuff you want and can get. Using that stuff,  however, is sorta bothersome. It often feels clunky. If you can imagine an intuitive way of interacting with a far away computer using a mobile phone, then lower your expectations and you'll be fine. The white icon is also no prize.
The best virtual pc emulator. Only thing leave unattended for awhile it shuts of for security reasons.does not support  full motion video or sound yet.
Fix runescape it kicks you off and doesnt let you on for a while.
I wouldn't recommend it to anyone trying to play runescape, laggy as hell even after I reduce the settings on fast internet. Good for checking ge but that's about it and still is slow.
Great for bnsf emulator but recently doesnt work getting a controller socket message?? Any ideas? Please fix?

Glad to have a way to use web apps through Linux on my EVO 3D and my Android Tablet.

Good concept, a bit slow even on WiFi or 4G (atl), and no sound support with flash...Evo
Works fine on Droid 3. Could improve in alot of areas.

Great app for accessing java on android phone. Did notice, however, that it crashes after a certain amount of time.
Lot of things to work on still, but adds tons of flexibility to my phone, and more importantly, to my Lapdock.
I would suggest making the application compatible with mouse ball phones
To anyone having BNSF emu issues, I switched to firefox in this app and it's working after all the java upgrades.
This is a good application and have used it extensively since starting with bnsf. Recently I noticed bnsf changed the emulator program and since then it will no longer launch from alwaysonpc. I don't think this is an issue specifically with alwaysonpc, bnsf changed something in their emulator code so that it no longer plays nice with alwaysonpc.
Like this app a lot only problem I have is when your in the app and go to your home and go right back you have to force the keyboard to open up again.
Everything works great on my droid x2 except I cant type anything anywhere, the keyboard will come up but I cant enter in a website or login! :(
I didnt realise this only works on Android 2.0 or later and I have 1.6. Their tech people very helpful & refunded. Shame, looks really good !
The app works great. I can play all of the flash games that I want, wherever I want. A couple of things I would like for them to improve are: 1. (I don't know if its just me) Scrolling is kind of difficult to do. I think they should do a update that lets you scroll whatever page you are on with your finger, like if you are in another web browser. 2. They should make a update to add sound. Other than that I say it is a app that is worth having if you have a android phone, but are missing flash.
Was expecting a little better performance, runescape is kinda of hard to play here but other flash games are okay

Does exactly what i want it to do. But doesnt open all the time. My touch slide
Awesome much better. Just wondering if u could add another way to right click I don't have multitouch on my phone. And could u play downloaded pc game
Great app! Needs ability to work with external whiteboards. Can only look but not draw or share files. See dabbleboard or twidla. Also need sound
I don't know why so many people are complaining this app works perfectly I don't see any lag although the screen sometimes goes black and I have to reconnect
Works perfectly on my Galaxy Proclaim so far.
Working great now...thanks
by faron of the best apps ive ever purchased!!!!
Works like a pc
Bought this ap on may 6th and it worked for 10 days and quite working said my subscribtion is past due on may 20 th
Yes u dont need the yearly $30 subscription bcuz of that this app is again best app i hav
It may be a bit slow even on a Galaxy S II but it's fast enough to use most websites I used to be able to browse only with a PC, and couldn't open with android natural resources. I really don't think it's overpriced, I see the 20 EUR as a very fair price. Now I just need to find a way to install a juniper vpn to work with this but maybe I'm hoping for too much But even without the ability to use a vpn, it's great value for money
the new version works alright now.
perfect great on xoom for bnsf emulator. Works on all the Android os's gingerbread, honeycomb, and the brand new ice cream sandwich!
Runescape won't work said untrusted site on java and I bought the app for runescape
If you play browser games that your phone can't handle, this is a great solution.
Works great on my sgs4g
Can play runescape well and all around works well.
This app is working perfectly :)
Had a problem with Java and now problem is fixed, thank you! Useful app
it is absolutely an amazing purchase but needs to be updated more.
Works very well.
downloaded on tablet and constantly crashes and is very slow! Do not waste your money! Bought to access college website from Samsung galaxy tablet and accesses website but crashes alot!

Gets the emulator
Works great for BNSF emulator, wish the key board had a tab key.
BNSF Web Emultator. The right app to have if you need to access the emulator and dont have a computer near by. A must have for all board 9 employees.
Love this app must have!
Works on LG Optimus. Problem with my account was resolved in a few days.

Decided to give it another go.. maybe just update the keyboard its kinda hard to surf?
Developer please fix or refund. Real great app but need this fix quickly.
Just unbelievable. The only caution for prospective users is to give yourself some time to practice and get used to with navigating on a small screen
Works flawlessly for bnsf emulator exactly what I was looking for
I wish it had the latest Java and could play minecraft!
Its great, the only thing it needs is the abiltiy to watch streaming video. And install programs. Then it will be the best app ever. S Galaxy Indulge

Comment still stays the same but I got a new phone with the dual core processor but my phone doesn't have a slide out keyboard. Any suggestions?
WARNING BEST APP EVER!!! ALL OPTOMUS V USERS NEED TO GET!!! AWESOME!!! DONT LISTEN TOO BAD COMMENTS!!! LG OPTOMUS V ! COOL AWESOMENESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I don't know why they call it alwaysonpc, as it shuts off for "security reasons" after a few minutes of inactivity, but its epic nonetheless!
Un-fing-believeable! This is hands down THE BEST app. This just opens so many doors! Awesome!
Wonderful app! I'm able to run a full blown google chrome with JAVA. A full streaming protocol is in the works to make it a lot better!
Kind of like a modern day Windows 3.1 but modern. Opens up feature not available on a phone alone. A++
