I love playing this game, but it does not work on my LG Ally! It won't even load and makes all my other apps not work either! Would give it 0 stars if I could! Deleted!
Was a good game except for having to have coins to play. But for two days now I can't even get the game to open at all.
Tglhe game is good but can not give a high rating because the game constantly freezes!  Galaxy S
Everytime i play this game it freezes my whole phone,was fine when i first started playing and i loved it but am now going to have to uninstall or ill  end up throwing my phone ! Frustrating !
The game is fun but it is constantly downloading movie trailers.  It typically uses 300mb of ram  even when not being used,  making it difficult to run other apps.
Lousy app
Tooooo many bugs and glitches. Slows down my entire tablet....uninstall
Always froze and made my phone restart
Upgrade stinks!!! Unable to appropriately place tiles, screen is too small and will not rotate for larger view. Goodbye to a once good game.
Such a shame..i downloaded this months ago, deleted it because it lagged horrendously and re-installed earlier today and this STILL has the same issue..guess i won't be playing this anymore..motorola triumph
I have to keep deleting this App, cuz when ur not playing, 60 mb keep running, taking up the space on my phone, slowing it down. I have saved on SD card, but still runs on phone itself, freezing my phone.
Game concept is fun but it keeps crashing n freezing n causing my phone to crash n freeze even when not in play :(. Had to uninstall... Now phone back to normal
This game is totally racist who thought of this shite
I wish I could give negative stars. They have enough ads the coins should be free.
Sucks. uninstalled.
Truly excellent game, great fun. My only gripe with it is it tends to freeze mid-way through games which can be frustrating. Please fix for 5 stars.  *UPDATE* Freezes virtually every time I play forcing me to restart rounds. Becoming unplayable! Please fix! I really don't want to uninstall as I really enjoy this game.  Fix for 5 Stars.  Still no fix.   UNINSTALLED.
the game is very slow sometimes dosnt load and crashes my phone so i have to take battery out to reset . i love the game but can't play any more as driving me around the bend. let me know when you make it comparable with galaxy ace
I liked this game before so   I reinstalled it.Guess what?didnt start up 3 times in a row!uninstalled :(
I'll see if it works now, or if Zynga continued its progressive screw up of games that once worked. I originally gave this game a 5 star rating. I'm hoping they have rolled it back to when it worked.  Update : removed it again. It caused the phone to crash and required phone resets even when it wasn't running  just like before.  I wish Zynga would learn that if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
I love this game but it never works well on my phone! It freezes up and causes my phone to power off
You have fun, its addictive... Than you have to wait 4 minutes to play unless you have TOKENS that you payed for to play ASAP! Lame penny pinchers...
Not enough to write home...
Force closed first time I tried to use it.
phone freezes and crashes every time.
Always hangs
lags and causes my android to freeze. love the game but will have to uninstall if the problem is not fixed
Wouldn't let me play got to the screen where you hit play I would hit play and it would take me to the previous screen they can suck it this is worthless!
I do not like being forced to buy tokens to play :(
Because I can't play this game
I use to love this game then all of a sudden it wouldn't open past the first screen.  I tried reloading it several times.  Never Worked again.
The coin limit for the free game I get, but even if you buy the game you're still limited!..Complete and total runbish! The popularity of this game is unfortunate since it only encourages this horrendous manipulation of people looking for a bit of fun...In a word, BOOOOO!
Fun game, my phone gets jacked up when install it though.
Screwing up my phone! So annoyed cuz I like scrambling
doesn't give me notification to make move, then auto resigns me. uninstalled!
Need more tokens to play
NO GOOD MAKE MY PHONE PERFORM BADLY HAVE TO UNINSTALL. TO BAD. BECAUSE I LIKE THE GAME.
Love the game, but limiting the number of times I can play through the coins is extremely frustrating and kind of a rip off, especially considering that the only way to get more coins (other than just waiting) is to buy them. Maybe you could come up with another way for players to earn coins, without needing a credit card.
Recently they removed the pics of people you were playing... Now, it's just scrambles assigned emails shown.
After update it keeps foreclising. Finish a game, asked to restart then foreclosed. Other than that it ok. 1 star. Fix it and v you will get 5
Game freezes and causes major delays.  Please fix. I used to enjoy playing my friends.
Freezes my phone up after installing. Has to uninstall before my phone would work properly
When the app was downloaded it added a wallpaper to my phone an I don't like that. Uninstall!!!!!
the game is great if you can get it on but I'm getting continuous abs at least 20 ads before u can play a game
Intrusive adverts that pop up while you are scrolling down to view your challengers
Made my phone slow and froze every time I used it. This.game is a piece of... junk.
Great game. Changed my rating after @1 week due to my phone/tablet constantly freezing since installation. Also I see the clock winding down many times but I am frozen and cannot play.
made my phone slow down to almost unusable. shame really. as loved all zynga games on iphone.
Terrible. Worst lagging game pin google play
At first it was fun but after a.few months it gets boring just to look for words in a given time. Now i think many games are way better people u should make it fun like every 2 week once make something new
It's fun, BUT this has to be the first game I ever played that makes my phone freezes like crazy!!
In the middle of one of my rounds.  While I was playing.  Screwed me up.  Just for that it loses 3 stars.  Otherwise it'd been a 4 star review.
This game is GARBAGE!  Been waiting for a long time for an update so this game wouldnt screw my phone.  Got the update and no improvement.  I hope this game and its creators get herpes... Droid X2
Lousy design. Shuts droid down every time I play. Not worth the frustration
Can't connect to Facebook, which means i can't get past the 1st screen. Update.
Slowed my phone done as soon as I opened it... worked halfway o.k the 1st 2 times I installed and uninstalled it.... PLEEEASE FIX this
Stop begging me to rate it
LAG LAG LAG LAG FREEZES UP MY PHONE!!! P.O.S!!!! SAMSUNG INFUSE 4G
Please fix! I love this game, but now it force closes from the login page. I miss playing it! Huawei Ascend II
It's a great game but it locks up everyone's phone including my own. I was hoping the update yesterday would fix it... no suck luck. I uninstalled it again.
Constant freezing and takes up a ridiculous amount if memory
Keeps forces closing
Fun game, but ruins my phone
Fun game but continually freezes phone have to hard boot...uninstalling.
Every time I play this game my phone lags and freezes and my phone shuts off. This is the ONLY app I have problems with. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app more than once and the same problems every time!!!
Super slow now
this game don't let me downloadthe game !
Is anyone else having issues with seeing comments? I can see the notification that there are comments but I can't see any comments there...? Maybe I missed something. Any suggestions?
Ever since I upgraded, it force closes after everyround. Completely destroyed the game for me
Hard to enjoy when it crashes and resets my phone after each person I play looking for replacement game
Great game, but not for Droids...continously locked up my phone to where I had to take my battery out to reset everything...i had to uninstall until the bugs get worked out
I DID give it 3 stars until I was asked AGAIN to rate.
Wants to access my phone history. Why would a game need to access my phone numbers, etc. for any legitimate purpose. No thanks.
Love this game. But keeps crashing. It sends in a crash report, but when it crashes, I lose all sounds on my razr. Everything except the ring on an incoming call. All apps disabled! I have to reboot my phone to get my sound back. WTF? No other app does that! Very frustrating! Plz fix.
On my phone the game seems to consume increasing amounts of memory while staying in background. Only way to get rid of the background service that I've found so far seems to be to force close it. The background service is active even if I disable notifications in-game. It's otherwise a good game but this problem is a complete deal breaker. Until it's fixed I'll rate 1.
Takes too much power and memory...actually bogs down my phone as a whole....but still a fun game
Token hog.  5 tokens a game???!!  Really!!
Fed up with the lag and force closes mid game. Wrecks my scores, so whats the point of playing? Uninstalling- Samsung Vibrant
It's a huge resource hog. This one takes up as much as 80MB while running in the background. Freezes, loses sound, most exciting part is killing the process and starting it over.  Maybe they'll eventually fix it, but I won't hold my breath.  Installed on both Galaxy S I and II with the same problems.
installed on LG Esteem, had to uninstall next day. RAM hog, froze other apps offer made them useless and sluggish. after uninstall and reboot, phone back to normal
love the game but it broke 3 of my Motorola Droid x2 phones!!!
I get notification by vibration. But no sound for notifications. Please fix. DROIDX
Glitches out and crashes. Not a well balanced game, anyway.
I never got to play froze at login each time I tried to play. Uninstalled!!
Why are the ads repeating over and over again?? That sucks big time!
Forever loading, it lags, freezes, and forcecloses. Had to un install. Very dissapointed. All the Zynga games suddenly started doing this.
Why this game asking for my password in email. So weird.
Can't get app to run on my OG Droid. Error comes up when trying to link with Facebook.
After uninstalling and reinstalling several times, nothing has been fixed. Game still stalls after second consecutive game. Alphabets become unresponsive to tapping but the time continues ticking. Had to reboot phone three times a day as the game affects proper function of the phone. My third review remains as ONE star.
Never got to play at all  Force closing and stalling my phone. My screen turns black for a very very long time. I'm sad!
It causes my phone to freeze up every time i open the app. Really enjoy the app but considering uninstalling due to issues.
It's bloat ware through and through. If you don't have a dual core phone, don't bother. Allows down and crashes your phone every so often
Downloaded this game to both my devices and like clockwork both completely stopped being able to get passed their intro screen. I'm warning everyone! BecAuse that being said, this game is the bomb
Wont let me log in. wont let me play, and keeps foreclosing..... Please fix, I like this game.
Freezes my whole phone. :P if fixed, then I'll download again..
I constantly have to uninstall and reinstall because it glitches and the letters don't light up when I make words... Still happening
Love the game, but uninstalled it after it started loading video ads, with sound, and a mandatory period where they can't be skipped. Completely unacceptable.
Love this.. The more I play the better I get...
it just force cloces do not download if u have galaxy ace.....
HTC EVO 4G- Opens to a blank green background and goes no further have to continuously press my back button to exit game :(:(:( plz fix
It kept showing down my Samsung Galaxy tablet after I played 3 consecutive games! So slow, that I would have to turn off my tablet for awhile! So I'm not sure if either this game is best for Android users, or it was full of virus'! Either way, I would not download this game, besides, since the Google play store is owned by Google,a free company that allows anyone to put out games to play, a lot of them have virus' in them.
How about it being FREE to play and extra coins ONLY when u use the extra power ups? Why coins just to play, anyway?
So slow and bugged. Have to shut out down each time I play it.
Force close is driving me crazy.
It was too slow.
I love this game but it wont let me log in...
Love it.
I love playing the game but it is extremely slow on my phone and is constantly making it freeze to the point that I have to restart my phone. Its very annoying and frustrating. I ended up deleted it
Constantly have to force close and freezes my phone
This game is still fun, but since update lags real bad.  At least on my Casio commando.  Boo!!!   Update- the latest update officially killed this app for my phone.  Super-lag and constant force closes...uninstalled !    So sad...
This game is good but it continues to freeze my phone. Since I downloaded it, my samsung galaxy phone also shuts off on its own too. Please fix this asap!
Was a great game. Now includes video ads which play between rounds and which attempt to force you to watch them. They actually have the gall to try to PREVENT you from exiting the program until you've let the ad play fully.  Avoid at all costs until this is corrected
Fun but turns my phone off alot and randomly exits the game.
Game keeps freezing and losing ally words/points. Really annoying and unfair!!
I love this game because it makes u really scramble for those words,but i wish that for every game you won u would get a couple of coins,cant do much till u run out of coins then wait 20 min to get a coin...that sucks! And i agree with the other players,u should be able to take players off or nudge them quiker wen they havent played for a while...other than that its a really fun game...
Quality game!!
It would be better if players took turns simultaneously. Or if there was a one player version.
This game force closes and freezes too often.  Fix it!  I have to remove the battery from my phone in order to reset it.
I love it its an awesome game. But it froze on me only once and restarted my phone
This game is fun but letters freeze too often!
It stinks that you can't play without purchasing tokens. Ridiculous
I love the game but need coins to play....Im not buying them!!!! Takes 20 min to get more!!? How about u just scrap that or add something that will allow you to earn more by getting a certain score or a certain number of words besides that I like it just takes forever to get coins to play
Take the coin gimmick away. It takes to long to keep a few games going.
The game was realllllly fun but slowed my phone down masivly. I thought my phone was broken until I uninstaled and my phone was fine.
It kinda ticks me off that when I'm trying to put in a word it doesn't recognize the word or it freezes up when I'm putting in a word, but the clock is still ticking.
It constantly causes my phone to freeze, causing me to do a battery pull after each time I play. Not worth it. I resigned my games and am now deleting the AP.  Motorola electrify.
can scramble stop pausing my game?sometimes i played,it would stop.please fix thank you.
can't see the image of the player.n frequently crash.
It only lets you play so many games and then it stops you from playing.
Keeps freezing when using power ups
Very slow...
I love this game its my favorite out of all , but now it won't renew my coin at all ....did they change this ?  It keeps saying buy coin its been two day and no new coins .. I won't be playing or buy any coins if they changed this !!!! ( So mad )
Lately, it won't light up on words that are right and its lagging a lot. It's annoying.
I can only play a couple of times at once because of the coins it takes forever to play all my freinds and I'm not spending real money on it.
Almost every time I played, my phone would then no longer have sound -- no ringtone, no notification sounds, was "unable to play" mp3s until a reboot.  Had to uninstall to keep my phone functional...
The game keeps freezing up. It force closes alot, and the worst part of it is, you have to wait for coins. Your max coins you can have is like 14, so lame. The winner should win some coins or so to make it more fun. Until all of the bs is fix, I rate this 2 stars, sorry.
Ugh..i was absolutely addicted to this game..until updates began making my game freeze and now im always having to reboot my phone..what an upset =(
It's fun but almost every time I pick a letter, it goes away and instead of spelling;  spelling, i make pelling and I waist several seconds trying to figure out what happened out of frustration!! Also, I KNOW I have spelt some words but I didn't get ANY credit for them. Please fix!!
It has to much problems
This app causes my phone to freak out! It shuts off randomly, freezes, and just doesn't work right!  I hope you can fix the program because this is my favorite app!
The advertisements are starting to annoy me
Makes my text stop coming through
Love it..!
If I play a few games in a row, the game freezes up. Even after reinstalling it still does. Love the game, hate the freezing.
Game not built for phone with RAM lower than 1GB. Causes lag/hangtime/freeze after playing 2-3 matches. Also caused a hardware error on my phone's speaker, and thanks to that my speaker is left permanently damaged. Tsk.
App keep crashing everytime I try to play a new game
Love the game don't agree with lack coins and so much to buy. Feel robbed if I buy them but enjoy when can play..
Great game
Not. Allowing. More than 9 ongoing games all of a sudden. Sucks!
Plz plz plz fix!!!! You said after the update we would b able to resign!! The effin nudge button just appears every time!!! Nd now it seems to be lagging ugh I love this game plz fix it!!! I have games over a week old that I can't resign ugh I mean just like words with friends it resigns itself I mean at least do that!!! Nd plz fix the lagging its not fair that I Swype a word nd it stalls but yet the time keeps going!! You guys r getting worse instead of better ..i'm taking stars away plz fix
My only complaint is that the game will not allow you to play if all your tokens are used up! You should be able to play without tokens if you so choose.
This app keeps lagging and freezing my phone. The number of ppl who have mentioned this is quite significant. I uninstalled it which is a shame as it was fun.
it always froze on my phone.I always have to turn my phone off.
When is this going to be fixed it seems as if it would've been taken care of by now
game used to work properly but now its very slow, makes phone freeze, makes phone turn off, can only just play two games before problems. used to be four stars now two at most.
This should be a feature. Hate that Zynga removed it.
Had to uninstall AGAIN... love the game BUT freezes my system :(
Good game but Crashes too often. Screen freezes & I lost all my points & have to start game again at 1.18sec
Can never find anyone on.
LOVE THE GAME BUT IT KEEPS CRASHING AND RESTARTING ON ITS OWN....I SEE ALOT OF COMMENTS WITH THE SAME COMPLAINTS...PLEASE FIX OR WILL DELETE
I was about to buy the game and then I discovered it costs a coin to play each round and when you run out you have to buy more coins or wait for a free one to appear which is apparently one every twenty minutes. The game can be paused so cheating is rampant (why not have a countdown to play simultaneously?) I am not going to buy a game that artificially limits my ability to play it. Next.
Game routinely causes my Android 2X to freeze. If I try to play the game, sometimes the timer will continue to count down, but the game is unresponsive. When I uninstall the game, my phone works great. Please fix this bug!
Game is good but very slow at times. Or tht could also b because m using samsung galaxy ace.
Shouldnt have to wait 20 minutes for a coin
I restarted my game more than 10 times and it keeps hanging midway through the game. Very frustrating. Can someone resolve this?
Fun game except for the lame tokens and it is a bit buggy. Ever since installing the app my phone had run slower and has to reload all my apps after hitting my home button. Much like it does when I turn of my phone and turn it back on. I am contemplating removing the app for this reason. Which sucks because it is a fun game.
I love this game but the app needs work. it crashes all the time, freezes and is a battery killer.
Can u please fix it.....
Phone freezes.  But it's so funnnnnnn
This game is kind of fun, but it takes quite a while to get the hang of. You can also only play 3 rounds with all the helps without paying for more coins, then you have to wait for more to build up over a few hours. For a game with ads, I feel like limiting how much you can play is kind of cheap. Unless you have friends who really like this game (in which case you should ne prepared to not win for a long time, of at all), pass on it.
Just finally updated and remembered why I hadn't before. PLEASE bring back the facebook photos of the person I'm playing against, and please fix the way the names are listed. I want to see my friends names - I don't know who zynga367963368 is! Very angry that I updated...
Great game bt I have an LG Optimus n will keep freezing on me..Kept having to restart my phone bcause it slowed down my phone..
Too bloated for me. Typical zynga focusing more on unnecessary flashy graphics than functionality.
This would be an awosome game but it freezes right in the middle of finding words. Fix that and u get 5. Warp
Small problems, it force closes at any given time, gets in the way of other apps from working properly & occasionally slows down or responds really slowly.
Lousy help from Inspiration, always give the same words, tease, tone etc
After the new update, the advertisement shows up like half the screen at the main page... pls fix
Great game but phone crashes every time I close the game. Galaxy s.
Freezes my phone to much or would be a 5 star rating!
I LOVE this game but... It is frustrating that u don't get coins when u win, I keep having to buy them and when u purchase them they do not automatically reproduce. WTH? It is super fun and I am addicted but u need to change the coin issue. I never have to spend $ on Words w Friends, shouldn't have to on this game either. NEED to change!!!!!!! PLEASE!!!! Otherwise I would give 5 stars.
The color doesn't look inviting. Change please
Love the game, but it freezes & crashes all the time. Now it won't update. LG Optimus - Droid
This is wonderful game and i enjoy playing everyday.
Addictive
it always freezes my phone (galaxy s+)...I hate it.
Can play the game but the lastest update can only show 1/3 of the screen because its covered by ads... Bugged ??
This app is very fun, but it Force Closes 3 or 4 times a day and I have to re register thru FB each time. I have the Android HTC one. Will bring my vote back up when fixed. Thanks.
My phone locks up nightly....such a bummer because I like the game. Zynga apps (WWF) seem to all do this.
Slow on Xperia mini pro
force closes and freezes my cell have to take battery out and back in when it happens. motorola droid x2.i love this game but i have to uninstall and reinstall alot just to play it because it freezes sometimes..also please add new letter grids. i play alot and notice sometimes the same grids coming up.. otherwise i would gave gave 5 *'s. still worth playing. fun!
This is a fun and addictive game but I uninstall it when I'm not playing because it makes my phone freeze constantly :(
Awesome
Too slow
Game was great, then randomly stopped working. Had to uninstall, now I am stuck with stupid ads again that I had already gotten rid of.
On Aug 12 started crashing on iPad.  Starts to open and then instantly closes. Still works on my DROID X.
Freezes my phone. Infuse 4g
I love this app, but the force closing and slowness of it infuriates me to no end. Please fix that and the loading time *5 minutes and having to force close it twice before my move is sent is ridiculous* I'm on LG genesis android. Fix the issues with an update to fix the bugs and ill rerate accordingly. Thanks bunches!
Just got a new phone last week and downloaded this game again and I am still having the same problems I had before with it freezing my phone. Love the game but if it keeps up I am going to uninstall it permanently! Fix this now!!!!! One less star..
I would love it if there was a little more time. Also, I would like to be able to quit or resign even when its not my turn. And, I don't like waiting around for other people. I would like to just play! I wish there was a solitaire version.
I love the app but waiting 20 minutes for a token is stupid. It should be like 5 or 10 minutes. I dont want to buy any tokens either. You should really get working on this because its just ridiculous
Wtv its ok
after reformatting my sd card...cant get the game re-installed on my Galaxy S.....other than that, great game!
Everytime my husband and I play against each other I end up losing because the stupid game will become extremely slow yet the time keeps going like the screen isn't freezing. So of course I lose because it doesn't pick up on words I have already found because its still trying to catch up....AAARRRRGGGHHH...I have uninstalled this game twice now and reinstalled...Hopefully 3rd times a charm and I can start winning again.
Good game, but it's always crashing my Android and making it reload. It's crashed twice where I had to uninstall it and reinstall it. Then i couldn't get the games back that I had going. I've about had it. If it crashes again, I'm uninstalling it permanently. Mediocre performance at best.
Lag
It makes my phone freeze.  -LG Thrill
It won't let me login on Facebook!!!! plz fix
It doesn't register and update on my phone. Please fix.
What is the problem love the game but keeps crashing
Love the game but it freezes way too much on Android Skyrocket. Even froze trying to write comments.  Can't you do something to stop this problem on Android?
Love the game, but locks and freezes phone whenever played.
The game is fun, but the app lags and crashes on my Samsung galaxy tab. Maybe its my tablet and not the app? Either way, I still play it.  Just wish it didn't lag.
Game kept freezing. Got 2 b very frustrating.
Good app!
love the game, but after a few moves, it freezes my galaxy phone. i have to remove the battery every time i play. just not worth it. don't have trouble with Words With Friends. odd & disappointing!
I enjoy the game,.HOWEVER I HATE people who stop paying halfway and then I left hanging on for 11 days....	How annoying to be enjoying a game and have 5 games open with one person that decides to just quit or be mean and there is nothing I can do.  So I uninstalled and reinstalled.
At last update you all increased the amount of coins required for power ups.   None of the other word games I play limit you to only a few games.  Uninstalling and sticking to WWF
Need more ways to earn coins
It's fun but it uses too many coins each time and takes too long for the coins to build back up.
Needs moree time.
It wud b nice to b able to delete inactive players before the current time limit automatically does so.  Also, it wud be good to be able to resign from a game on their turn if needed.
Absolutely love the game but it slows my phone down loads!!
it always loads so slowly ..an then crashes my phone FIX IT .........
This game has token bugg
It is okay...
Played a game got half way into it and the ganesh stopped in the middle wtf
Very smooth and well made app. I've been playing with friends and strangers daily for a few months.
I never have enough time to get all words I see
Fun but turns my phone off alot and randomly exits the game.
I love the game but have repeatedly had to uninstall then reinstall because it freezes & closes.  It always works great when I get it reinstalled, for awhile.
I like this game. It's challenging but it keeps freezing up once you get a few words. Please fix this. Once fixed ill rate five stars.
Fun but a little laggy.
Tokens take to long but  great game
If after 3 days an opponent doesn't play? The game is dropped. Face it...they are not coming back. Change this please!
Great game! Deserves 5 stars but I have to close the game while playing because it freezes and lags so bad.  Also, the time it takes to get more coins is ridiculous. Please fix issues!!!
haha still not bad
LOVE this game but the winner should be able to win a coin. But great game!  Kudos!! PS- KEEPS FREEZING UP lost a star!   And i bought coins ... which should be 99 cents, not 2.99 minimum ... and when I bought coins, I no longer accumulated coins every twenty minutes!  That's ridiculous!  Doesn't pay to buy coins! Another star lost.  :-(
seems like a great game in a good interface but, when you have a lot of friends like to play this game your tokens go extremely fast
fun game but it can be very very slow at times
Only bad things are you can only have so many games going at one time, you don't earn coins for winning so you only get so many coins per time period and have to wait to okay again once you use three coins all up until they replenish
I like the game it a good way past the time. I hate the fact that you have to buy tokens but other then that a reallu good game
I enjoy the game but what happens when you run out of coins???  I can't play anymore cuz I have no more coins.....
Wish there was a pass and play option. Also, often when I am playing a word it falters and I lose time.
Great Game!!
when using inspiration I have experienced serval times that word on the list were not found on the grid
Needs more coins
I love the game, but it keep on locking up on me and I can't do anything on my phone. I have to pull out the battery to fix it. If it keep up I'm going to uninstall it
The coins take way too long to regenerate. It should not take a coin to play. Coins should be only for boosters. Plus the third boost should be two coins not three.
Love this game but it keeps making my phone freeze please fix do I download it again ( I have a samsung admire) :)
excellent game but keeps sticking! which gets very frustrating. iv tried deleting the app an re-installing it so fingers crossed.
Id give my 5stars if you can give a free token as a price for the winner.
Be better without having to use coins
Freezes up a lot but really enjoy the game
Its Ok. Seems slow on my phone. Ok game though.
its always crashing..if u cud just fix that.
I love this game. Only problem is it lags and backs out of game sometimes. Please fix bugs. :-)
Since last update game constantly freezes, shuts off, loses coins, loses games, starts games over.  New helps hardly worth it.
I love it
Slow sometimes
Game is fun, have some freezes.
Crashes quiet often or won't load...
To many ads
I enjoy playing this game but it's irritating when you run out of coins and have to wait. Even if you only use the free one (scramble etc..) multiple games will deplete them quickly. The paid version says twice as fast but still not enough. Definitely not paying for more coins.
Tokens feature sucks!
I love, love, livre this game but it freezes all the time. I wish they could fix this so I don't have to keep shutting my phone down.
Thank you very much for having scramble. It does help improve my spelling skills and help me thinks faster. Again, thank you very much.
I agree that the free coins don't come quickly enough.... Only able to play three games a day or spend money.
Freezes and force closes a lot on Samsung Galaxy
So. Freakin. Awesome.
WONDERING WHY I CAN'T READ MESSAGES WHEN PLAYERS SEND ME A MESSAGE ITS ANYBODY ELSE HAVING THIS PROBLEM???
After playing this game for a while... It seems there is a bot playing because there is no way someone can get 700 points or about 60 words from this game. Impossible. The game is good but I want to see if you can fix this flaw.
Very addictive & fun but starting to see the same letter combos over and over ..also. .if people don't start their round for a week,  you can't play if you are waiting on too many people. .lastly. .horrible performance, freezes a lot, forces shut down a lot
Wish it wouldn't freeze up during a tournament. Very frustrating. Also, I wish you could earn tokens by winning a game or round, instead of waiting for them.
Great game freezes @ times
I love the game.but freezes way too much and makes my phone slow.
Good game, occasionally the game play is sluggish but overall solid. They are cheap on the coins, it's hard to get into because you run out of coins so quickly.
Fun game. They need to stop being so cheap with the coins tho.  You can basically play 4 games, then you have to wait 6-8 hours to play again.
Freezes when you play alot of games
If it didn't lag and force close it would be five stars.
Problem is it freezes after I play a few games. Once it froze when I hit the done button but it was scoring me even thought I couldn't see the game board so I got a zero for round 2 of that game. I keep playing though because I love this game! Lol I have a 7 inch galaxy tablet.
Hate having to earn coins to play!
This is a great new game but it lags way too much and slows everything down.
Good when it loads. Takes some time to catch up andsometimes forces application to close.
Love the game but waiting to play when ur out of tokens stinks.
Have problems with the game slowing during play, most times stopping.  Otherwise, great game to play with friends.
If a player hasn't played in a while you can't delete them to make room for more matches
Seems to run a little slow on my Android
Fun!!!
I never get bored with it and always love playing when I get a little extra time in my day! It's very addicting! I have no complaints about it at all! Very good game!
Game is so fun however force closes often or requires a complete shut down due to freezing.
Love it, good sometimes freezes up on my galaxy. I just enjoy the brain workout
It's ok I guess. Feel free to play me anytime
Great game, very addictive. The only bad thing having to wait 20 minutes for 1 coin so the excitement wears off.
only thing is my phone has started freezing since downloading this game
I love this game
Good game. Serious battery drainer even when I haven't opened it. Verizon gnex
Really LoVe the game but can you PLEASE fix the glitches with the time game gets stucks and makes weird noises even when the app is closed other than that it would get a 5 star from me
Would be 4 stars without ads
Hands down, this is my favorite game to play on my phone! It loads very, very slowly and makes my phone run slower overall. I'm not sure if that's the fault of the game or the phone, but my other games don't do that. Nonetheless, the gamenis worth it!
I really love playing this game but I have noticed when I play 3 or 4 games in a row my phone starts running slow or the game itself starts to freeze up and or run slow as well.
So much fun!! But take tokens away, I have to wait hours to continue a game because of them. Fix that and gets 5 stars
I'm rating this a 3 due to the fact u can only play 10 games. You should be able to play more. Hopefully they change this 15 would be nice.
I enjoy this game and play regulary. About a week ago the game just deleted my name and facebook that I had linked and now it wants me to set up a new account, not cool, not at all.
Good game, but freezes a lot.
Would like to delete people after about a day without it going against my winning average. Also hate that I have to wait so long to recop more coins. Would like to see more letters in rotation so a larger variety of words can be spelled. Otherwise, the game is pretty fun.	It's pretty cool
Need more time!
Really easy for ppl to win if they have coins and use "inspiration". Its annoying because its easy to win without trying. Thats my only complaint, maybe make more useful cheats like that cost more coins so its a bit harder to get. Like freeze could be free because it helps without giving words but other two need to be harder to get. Runs pretty good, but sometimes lags.
Its ok except every three or four games i play it totally shuts down my phone n makes it re start... need to fix that issue!  Model: ZTE WARP
Fun game! BUT...ToO many force close & it slows down my phone way too much!
Could be a like better
I only wish it wouldn't crash that much and got coins faster but I still love this game i
I've really tried to get this but. I'm still not seeing the words till after the time is up. Not a game for who try to hard. I'm hearing you need to relax. Baahahaha!
I will rate a lot higher if they fix the bugs. It causes my phone to lag and freeze to the point where the battery needs to be removed to get it to function again. Otherwise, lots of fun!
Love. It!! But it freezes up alot
Great game but it just takes too long to earn more coins .!
I like this game . It would be great if the letters wouldn't freeze up and the timer keeps going .
Game is fun doesn't always work on my phone
Not happy with the new movie previews after each game!
I like the game, howevet, I do not like the coins every 20 minutes
However please cut the coin time at least in half of the time. 20mins is way too long to wait. 10mins is fine by me gives me a chance to play more games. Not that I don't want to buy them but I can't afford them right now times are tough and all.
I enjoy playing this game. Would love more coins.
Really great game.......The only two things are that  I wish people could play against the computer instead of opponents because of the wait time........I have played people one round per day........That's no fun having to wait.......The other thing is get rid of the coins and have unlimited play.......I would love to play longer that a hand full of games and then wait on coins to complete a game
Fun!
I think we should have more coins for more playtime
Its a good game I enjoy it.
My favorite game but my phone becomes very warm & it crashes. Pleasee fix this
Only problem is that the tokens go quickly and you cannot play without tokens.
Love it but It makes my samgung transforl ultra go super slow and crash
good fun to play, but really annoying when it freezes and shuts my phone down.
It's a shame you have to buy tokens and that you can't have it charged to your phone bill. Otherwise it is lots of fun!!
Wish didn't have to wait so long for tokens.
But crashes if you create words too fast. Please sort it out. Running on Gingerbread.
It's fun enough. Annoying that you wait 20 minutes for a coin. The ads don't bother me.
I really like this game/app but I hate how I run out of coins and I cant play any more at all...unless I buy coins. Dislike!
I used to be able to play this game just fine but then it started to glitch and started to mess up my phone and making it really slow...I've tried to re-install it to see if it would work BUT IT DOESN'T!!! I miss playing this game with friends!!!
I really like this game. It is addictive and I enjoy the competition between my friends. But it can no longer be advertised as free esp. when its a 5 token per game charge.
I enjoy playing this game. Especially when I'm bored and need something to do real quick. Helps keep the mind sharp too.
I luke this game. It's ready enough to play buy I'm confused about the tokens and how they're to be used
I really enjoy the game, but after leave the app, it keeps running in the background and uses up so much memory that my phone is basically useless. Fix this bug and this gamer will be highly recommended!
Love the game but wish it was another way to get coins other then waiting it out or paying real money
I hate the way you hate limited coins so you can't play more than a couple rounds at a time.
Great, fun game but it freezes too much on my lg optimus!
No refresh button No game stats Innovative but could've been lot better
Its a fun game and usually works but it will sometimes lag really bad or just unexpectedly shut down in the middle of the game.
Good game, but sometimes freezes write the clock is still running.  Very irritating.
Hours of fun!! A must have!!
This game would be awesome if it had a single player option! And a way to earn more tokens instead if paying for even or waiting forever to get more!
Love this game & it would get a higher rating, but it causes my Galaxy S to freeze or crash and I have to take the battery out of the phone to fix it.
It could use a pass and play.
It is ok
I love the game except waiting for people to play. I should be able to challenge myself while i wait. Also when using the inspiration feature, often times the words needed to be find are never shown so I'm still just guessing. a waste of a coin.
Fun and exciting but should provide more tokens =[
Very fun but game crashes and the phone shuts off also I lose a lot because the phone can't keep up
Great game. Addictive
Love this game but the touch responsiveness is not as good as it is on the iPhone. Making it hard to compete against iPhone users
Would be 5 stars if the coins were replaced faster or if there were no coins required. 20 mins for 1 coin is ridiculous.
Freezes up phone, and gm. Super fun, yet everyone stayes this. Why doesnt time freeze?
Good game, but freezes a lot
Provide more coins. Shorten coin replenish time from 20 to 5 minutes or charge less for the options.
I really enjoy playing this game when it works. It freezes alot. Sometimes I lose time but occasionally I have to restart my phone (or it restarts on its own).
After enjoying playing this with my friends,  I now realize that many of the same words are repeated,  I have yet to see words with the letter K... May uninstall and recommend same to friends if not fixed.
Its fun, but it has been shutting my phone down and restarting it. Its a bit buggy.
The update helped a lot in performance of the game but, even still, this game uses up a lot of ram which causes my samsung galaxy tablet to freeze. Please fix this is my favorite game to play.
It force closes all the time then really slows my phone down and freezes it.
its ok, it freezes alot and makes me lose points, and I think you should win coins everytime you win, not use them everytime you play
This game is amazing and super fun
I lovechild app, the only thing is I wish we could like pick opponents, insted of random picking
Too much fun
Boring
Enjoy playing the game.
Very fun and addictive game but if you have the Droid X2, do NOT bother cause it will slow your phone and freezes sometimes along with force closes.
Otherwise it is a great app... but way too many.
Love game i have android zte and when i play this game it freezes and my phone also reboots...seems to freeze if i play while phone is charging as well....my phone has a problem mainly with just this game ****FIX THE FREEZING I WILL RATE 5STARS!!!!!!! Thanks
Game keeps glitching and makes my samsung admire freeze up to the point that I have manually restart my phone. Game would be 5 stars if it werent for the glitches.
Game is addictive and fun, but lots of glitches and forces close often.
I. Like the game but also find fault in the "waiting" for moves. I also had to recently uninstall & reinstall the game to get my next rounf of moves.
Fun but all games require tokens and u have to wait for more tokens to continue to play, probably would have still downloaded though.
Love the game, hate that u have to buy tokens or wait 20 minutes just for one...no other scrabble game makes u pay to play..would be alot more fun if u could play whenever u want
Freezes my phone all the time but love the game.
It is kind of fun but time limits are annoying.  It is also hard to read the little choices for perks in a game. I do not often feel up for all this!
It freezes a lot
When I was trying to create new games,it told me that I have reached the maximum games that I could create,while I only have 3 awaiting games.
y is there an ad taking up half the screen?
Takes too long to find if it's my turn
Not too bad
Dislike having to wait for someone else to play.
Fun game, love it but freezing is really starting to f me off, could this be a Motorola compatibilty thing? Have seen a lot of comments similar from Moto's
i like the game but too many concerns that i wld like to bring to your attention...first this game crashes phone...causes to restart 2nd:i have a whole list of people that haven't played their turn...either updated or I'll reuninstall..
After about 6-7 games it freezes and the timer still goes. I'm not able to make words for at least the last 20 seconds.
Very fun addicting game, but waiting for required tokens to play is just plain stupid. Eliminate the token aspect and it's a top game.
Cool game. Wish they had cumulative stats though.
Freezes randomly, and sometimes causes the phone to freeze (HTC inspire)
it's glitchy. It stops and stalls on me during game play. Besides that, it's fun.
Annoying tokens and adds. Otherwise ok.
Pretty fun and addicting at first. Dont think i ever had any tech problems. Good download for killing time.
But...makes my phone freeze up and constantly either have to do a full shut off or the app closes itself which is kinda frustrating when you are in the middle of a game!
GREAT GAME...EXCEPT CONSTANTLY FREEZES UP MY PHONE. Uninstalled and reinstalled 4 times. Nothing helps. Please fix
Awesome game, but causes my phone to crash and restart. Droid x2.
I wish the chips regenerated faster.
Fun game!!!!
Enjoy the game but freezes up a lot HTC inspire!
I really love this game but always run out of coins so I have to stop playing.
This is a fun game, need to collect coins faster. I've tried buying coins as well as the game and it always says theres an error. Both my kids and my husband have purchased the game from their phones, so not sure what the problem is. Enjoy when I get to play.
I love this addictive game.
Horrible to see that the ads cover half the page on my favourite scramble application after the update.
This game is probably the most fun game i've played on the market, everytime i run it it causes my phone to be extremely laggy.  The only way to get it to start working correctly is to do a battery pull.  Taskkillers help the lag, bu they dont completely get rid of it.  I also can only do a round or 2 before the lag gets so bad that my round clock goes from like a minute left then lags out and the round is over.  It is so frustrating at times to deal with, but when it is running good,this is by far the best
A fun game. The coins are stupid. But generally a fun game.
alittle slow but good to play when you're bored
Not bad
Should have way more coins
I installed this on my samsung repp, and right away when I launched it encountered problems loading the game. Played 2 rounds with friends and everything stalled, restart phone. Went through this twice, removed battery and am now scared to try launching the game again as my other apps are finally working properly again. Love the game itself, just scared to play it on my phone now :-(
annoying ad bar is WAY TOO BIG!!!!
Since I downloaded this, my phones been slower, and causes everything to force close... I moved it to my SD card, and same thing.... I am now trying to uninstall, then re install..  How it helps, this game is addictive and fun
I've always liked this game, but come on.  Why do you guys need to know of I'm in the middle of a phone call?
It is an addictive game that keeps you on your toes. But sometimes my phone's processor can't keep up with my finger movements--the clock keeps running tho! It gets frustrating when that happens cuz I know I could have better scores. Please try to write a leaner update. Maybe less flash would yield better performance?
Fun and addictive game but developer should add delete feature to clear rounds that aren't finished by opponents! I've reached my limit to start new games and it's frustrating waiting on others to either complete or resign current rounds. PLEASE ADD DELETE FEATURE! Thx.
...had to uninstall because the latest version jumped the size from about 5MB to 16 MB. I don't think that kind of size increase was necessary in one update.
You can finally quit a game!
Can't even get into the game I click the icon & immediately force closes
Get rid of pay to play app purchasing.  Will be games downfall if not fixed.
:) I like the game but, having to  force close every time is annoying. I'm so addicted to this game.
Fun to play but keeps crashing. Seems to have slowed down my mobile too.
So fun, could play for hours. Only complaint is that the coin thing stops me from playing as much as I'd like. More words would be cool too.
This is a great game and I haven't had to worry about it freezing up or have it force stop.
Luv this game gets my mind moving thnx for the challenge at the same time this freezing during the game n the force closes r quite perturbing
why my s3 cannot login with facebook account?
Love this game, but I have to force close alot.  Also, too little tokens without any chance of winning them.
I absolutely loved this game until it started freezing at least 3 out of 6 games ( I played a lot). I wish they would fix that. Other than that I love the concept of the game.
It can be a ripe off .   You use tokens and people decline and you don't get the tokens back. It's ridiculous to pay for tokens also. The should be free!
Just wish u didnt have to wait so long for coins.
Makes my phone slow. Fun to play, but keeps force closing.
But it ALWAYS freezes :-(
Love the game. Wish we had a longer play time! AND wish we didn't have to use tokens on a "free" game!!
Freezes when u don't want it to
Love the game.... Tired of the token thing! It was cool that you added a third option but for 5 tokens?! I like this game but this is just annoying already!
Love playing with friends.
Fun game but freezes up all the time. Cache is high too. Maybe will get better.
needs bug fixes, n makes my phone freeze up...
Wish there was a way to play solo to get practice.
Good game but it keeps freezing and I always end up having to turn off my phone
Love the game but it freezes up sometimes & shuts down my phone.
Kinda fun to play if you like word-search games, cool that it has live play too. But it's a pain to have to go into utility and force it out of massive memory.
Please make out smoother for Samsung phone. Always hang in the middle of a game.
Fun
Great  game  but opens  entirely  to slow ......
Love the game! freezes when it can.t keep up with scoring. Touch screen freezes. Sound goes off
Fun, but I don't like having to wait for coins just to play a round.
I'm unable to play the game because a lot of my friends games are dormant. please create a delete button to remove them. thanks
crashes on my exhibit 2 but worth the headaches!
I love this game!! So addicting! Just wish you could get more coins for winning.
The app it kinda slow but still love the game!
Love this game but it always freezes and the coins take to long to get if you play alot like me
Cant delete people not playing
Game is ok sucks you have to have tokens
Love the challenge but, need longer play time and less need of tokens
Not as fun as words with friends.
Regularly crashes on me...
Need sort out the game crashing very often!
I love this game but it is very slow and slows my andriod down a lot. Fix that and it will be awesome!
CNN cm CNN
Run out of tiles too fast & then they want to charge you for them.
I love the game but that's when it is not freezing up and forcing close!!!
Great game to play with friends and family. Program on my phone seems to slow things down a lot, could be playing and cannot type word, it then pauses and time is still running and sometimes it forces me to have to shut down and reboot.
The app works great and its a fun game. Wish there were more than 3 rounds. Per game.
-stars because I don't receive any notifications, EVER :(
Fun game reminiscent of boggle.  Fast game play.  I really enjoy it EXCEPT for the tokens.  You can only take so many turns until you have to wait for your tokens to come back.   I can't imagine having to wait for tokens in words with friends!  It runs fine on my DROIDX 2.  No lagging.  Tokens are thumbs down.  **Lost a star after last update**  Game only loads occasionally and when it does I'm lucky to get one game in before it crashes!!!!
Great game. My only issue is that it occasionally locks up my phone and causes a forced close, usually in the middle of a game. When that happens, I lose every thing I did in that turn and have to start over.
I really love this game but it KILLS my RAM!! Why does it need to run on 220mb-336mb RAM at times?! Redonkulous
Fun but lots of levels repeat... See lots of same words... Winner of each round should get a coin! Coin system limits play.
Freezes too much!!!
It's a gd game, but I hate the token part. If you can keep playing or earn more tokens
The screens seem to repeat a lot
I hate when I lose coins hate it!
Takes to long to regain coins, but is overall a good game.
I really enjoy this game its lots of fun I been hooked since the first time I played but I do have some complaints I hate waiting 20 mins for more coins why must we wait 20 mins 2 get only 1 coin? Why don't the winners get rewarded coins 4 high scores? Why not reward the players with coins 4 spelling big words? I hate it when I wait 20 mins 4 a coin 2 play and my screen freezes up r even worse than that my phone totally shuts itself off!! I luv the game but hate the flaws!!
Force closes on Toshiba thrive
It freezes sometimes but is fun!
The original version I downloaded was the best, but I have auto update on and the last few have made me like the game less. I play against some really good players and limiting me to only choose 2 inspirations lowers my chances of winning. Change it back to choosing 3 of the same power-ups would help even things back up with competition!
Smart match create problems. Waiting days for game to complete.(presently on a game for 6 days. Waiting on other player) game should have a time-out feature or the ability to resign at any point in the game.
Would've been higher except for putting the ads on there that you exit out of for a minimum of 5 sec, it gets irritating, i'm not gonna pay or donate on a game like this so ill probably uninstall if they keep doing it
Wish the number of games I played or how I played weren't dependent on coins that refill one at a time every 20 minutes. Also wish i could play in.my own, like practice. These limitations make me too lazy to play consistently whichmay be a good thing. Otherwise I would be addicted to this copy cat version of Boggle.
Nobody wants to play with me cause I am so flipping good!
You say they will be at our skill level, but I have yet to get one. They are all way too low or WAY to high.
With the new evo update we no longer get notifications when it's our turn. Fix that and you get five stars!
Love playing, dislike token aspect, and locks my phone up frequently.
Has alot of freezing that leads to other problems so annoying I uninstalled. But I do love the game its awesome. Needs improvement though
Fun to play with friends overall but too many errors and freezes a lot!
Scramble: love it just don't like when it freezes or I have to force close it.
Been playing for awhile and love it.  But just started getting unexpected stops and has to be forced closed every time I play!  Installed the update hoping that would help but it didn't.  Please fix!  HTC REZOUND.
Needs moree time.
Stop changing my wallpaper!!!!!!!!!!!  You take my coin for a game, then skip back to home frame.   I have to use another coin to play same game!!!! Otherwise, I like the game.
Why do you need coins the play normal games? I also dont like playing random as its obs they ate cheating. Great game to play with people you know. Same problem with wordswithfriend, can only resign when your go
Good game
Wish there was a pass and play option so I could play with my kids, or practice by myself and not have to wait on someone elses turn!
Fun game but tokens take too long to generate and are not worth buying.
I like this game very much.. itz was fun. :)
This game is a blast to play. Probably the best out there. Sadly, it constantly crashes my phone, and locks up all my phone functions. Game gets locked sometimes during my turn. The coins are a total rip off.
Great game, but it would be alot better if you got coins you win
It takes my phone cpu to 100 percent. Hangs the game so loose time and chances to grab words.
A big update would be nice. Can't play with some of my friends
I wish the developer could fix the problem where scramble always force closes on Samsung phones	My Samsung tablet constantly freezes up and my HTC phone always re-boots upon exiting. Needs to be fixed. Verizon suggested I should un-install Scramble. . . Don
Fun game, but cant get it to not stop and go back to menu midgame..reinstalled twice! Ugh!
Fun!
This is fun. I wish you could play single-player practice rounds though; it makes you play against an actual opponent and that requires data connection
Wish you could end/resign from a game.
It seems to me that the updates alternate between making it slower nd making it faster. Running on android 2.2 though so that might be the culprit
This is a great game that will satisfy the competitive nerd in all of us!
Hard to play without sounds! Haha, tokens take awhile to build up, but very addictive
Keeps us all occupied for hours.
Fun. Takes some practice and wish you were given more time but still fun
Tends to freeze up my galaxy S II, but a fun game
Keep practicing!
Keep running out of tokens if playing with multiple friends and I am not spending money to buy more
Fun game.
Good game. Very fun!!!
Dope game wish we could get coins more often free by winning or bonus idk luv it though
It is so much fun but I think that it could have a lil more time while ur doing it or the person who is playing should choose howbmuch time is on the clock
Already addicted!
Good game to play with friends
Playing with all my family and fb friends. Fun game
Fun
I'm bad at it, but it's very well designed. Good game.
So addictive
I love the game i just hate waiting to get new coins.
Kinda fun.
Easily the most fun & addictive game I've played in a while. Is like words on crack. The only down side is the token system. Waiting to replenish blows & the token packages are a rip off.
Lots of fun,  and no issues at all with it. !! Thank you
So addictive
really fun
Great game but it locks my phone up
good game. we enjoy playing the game most of the time.
Just as the sister game words with friends it needs to update with Facebook!
Nice.
Fun to play against friends.
Mesmerize: I just wish that there was a time limit to play your next turn . I have a couple of games that are over a week old. I have to forfeit and lose, not them :(   otherwise its a very addictive and fun game to play.   love it !!!!
Love this game!!!!
Great app but the phone hangs..samsung galaxy s2
great game on vocabulary improvemeny
Great, fun game! Too long a wait for more coins though.
This is a really good educational, but fun game. Great to be able to connect with friends through facebook. Equivalent to Boggle but different due to double and triple letter bonuses. One really needed option in a future update is some kind of practice mode where you can practice by yourself.
Love it
Addicting and fun!
I <3 this game
Fun to play. Only down fall is the tokens off you play multiple games.
I love this game. It gets really laggy sometimes though. That's a problem but other than that great game.
love the game
BUT need to load up coins much faster... That will get 5 stars from me!
My only issue is while I'm in the middle of the game it freezes up sometime.....
Even without using the power up option it still charges a coin and I don't want to post for more.
GET RID OF THE COINS! OR MAKE IT EASIER TO EARN MORE!
Great game.
I love it its an awesome game. But it froze on me only once and restarted my phone
Hooked to this game.. will be good to see new boards ;-)
It's a great game. I hate the fact that I run out of coins so fast! I recommended the coin system be demolished or we win new coins ever time we win a game
Great game. Very fun when you have a couple minutes to kill
Very good but freezes too   much. U must pace urself to play for free, but game is so addictive that it's worth it.
Completely addicted!
Great game....addictive!!!!   Would be nice if we could win coins.
Tons of fun
Great Game!!
Totallt addicted. Wish it would let me pick an opponent from my contact list, not just facebook connect. But the game play is great.
Like the game alot I just wish the coins didn't take so long to build back up! Change that and it'll be perfect
More coins in shorter time
Addictive game. Just typical Zynga needing coins for something else. Besides that I really enjoy it.
great game
Awesome and addictive game that generally works great on my Galaxy SIII. Would be better if the game had a practice mode.
Good way to play with friends you don't see often
So much fun I love  their new upgrades
Runs pretty smooth on my Samsung tablet and phone! Not loving that I have to wait for coins and agree that winner should get coin incentives! Still a fun game to play!
Already addicted in one day!
I basically love this game but I would very much like to be able to play on my own without a "friend".  Is that possible
Too bad I stink!
Fantastic
Luv this game
love it
It really makes u think an gets u to really look for the words they r not jus all right there for u
It passses time love it
Great fun!!
With the recent update it has been giving me error while connecting. Please fix!
Love it!
I enjoy gaming all words but I'd like to end a game even when it's not my turn instead of waiting 7 plus days for the game to end. Takes up room for willing match opponents.
Love this game but wish we had more tokens =/ I hate waiting for 19 or 20 minutes
Definitely addictive and fun!!
I love this game. It's a great time passer. Gets pretty competitive. Only thing is I wish is if  you could play multiplayer on the phone against people. Works great on mytouch 4g Slide
i can't invite anyone if i don't have facebook! i want that option back
Love this game so addicted!!
Great game
Seems to freeze my galaxy a
I like this game better than words with friends. But the whole token thing kind of sucks. I would have given it 5 stars.
Good to play but another minute would be nice.
Great!
Good, but it makes my phone lag.
Like it, fun and nice. Only slightly slow in response.
Love, love this game..would get a 5 if I could play against the computer:-)
Great game.
Fun
Fun game to play. My 9 year old loves to play also!!
Love the game
Would like to resign games if opponent isn't playing anymore.
A fun game to play.
so fun
love it
Good game to play with co-workers when nothing is going on
Thx for the best game
Faster & no more hanging..
What a great, fun way to interact with family & friends. I play with friends from school that I have not heard from in over 10 years, and we all have a blast. Thanks for the great game.
Really good...I would have loved it more..if I could play myself without time limit and than get a solution, once I submit my score
Love the game but randomly freezes sometimes. Have to force close the app in order for it to work again.
Pretty fun and addictive game. Also very entertaining to compete with your friends.
Absolute fun !!  Recommend to one and all.
This game is a way to pass the time and I love it! The only thing I don't like about it, it's the way it has tokens
New to it ...but really like it. Fun....
Love it!
Great
I have noticed that recently there is a difference between the score i am given at the end of the round and the one given for the same round on the totals page. I have had several rounds where my score is higher and then on the totals page, the score shown for that round is much lower. What's up with that?   I'm getting robbed!   Oh... and additional coins should also be given as reward for winning and loyalty coins too!
I love the game, especially the Facebook connectivity that allows me to play against my FB friends. So addicting!
Good game. Great when bored for people who enjoy word games.
LOVE the game but the tokens are a pain. Would pay for unlimited games. Would like to be able to play against the computer when no opponent is available (without using a token).
Luv it
Pretty fun and addicting
It's a pretty fun game.
I had some issues with it at first but I uninstalled and reinstalled it and things are running smooth.  Love the game.
Way better than words w. Friends ... Just wish you got coins faster FIX PLEASE !
Fun game once you understand the coins and points.
The updated is great & I enjoy playing!
Only negative comment would have to be waiting on coins to play. You should have the option to play even if you are out of coins.
Do wish I didn't have to wait for tokens!
Having fun...runs perfectly on Samsung tablet...
Love it ..
The game is awesome. However it freezes my tablet and makes everything.run slow..
Great game works perfect
I was just indroduced to this game n its pretty coo, wish u didn't have to wait 20 mins to get only one coin to get the goodies or play another person. But other then that I like it.
Very fun and challenging.
Wish it had more coins but it passes time n exercises the brain
Pretty good, especially now I can play with people at my level, more chance of winning! Runs really smooth, no faults.
Simply love it!!
Most Addictive game I have played in a while. Great cause u can play with others also
This is a really good app but needs more coverage to attract more players I.E. facebook
Fun game.
Not a flaw at all in its entertainment.
Love the game,but would like it more if we had 1more minute of time & 1xtra vision/freeze/inspiration/letter switch to use.So instead of 3 total,4pls!
Very slow...
Addiction at it's best
Im still trying to broaden my vocabulary skills so I can win a few more games. Great app though.
Great game, fun and addictive.. But wish theres an offline mode for practice or whatsoever... Peace out
Fun game
Good way to spend the time....
Good game. Exercises your mind...
Love this game
Great, fun game in 2 minutes or less!
It def helps past tha time. I play almost er'day!!!
The best game to pass time and also able to learn more words
Very well-designed and addictive game. Would be 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that it hogs up RAM and tends to freeze after a while of playing because of this.
Great fun game but it sometimes freezes my Droid 3 and forces it to restart.
For some reason the games aren't updating on my phone, but will update on my ipad :(
Fun and addictive!
great way to play with my daughter across country
Nice
I love it !
lots of fun with both my kids & wife all hooked!
Addicting... Would've given it 5 stars if you gained coins when you win the round...
Goooooooood game. Brain teaser  that forces one to use ones mind. Four stars only because five represents perfection and no one or nothing is perfect.
Fun!
Addicting game!!
I like it
It freezes up my samsung android ... But its fun
Good game but hate u gotta wait for tokens but fun to kill time
the reason I give this a 4 out of 5 is because I'm really new at 2 words but I know a lot of words and so far this game is really help me to learn to use other words and has been fun so far for me to play
Great fun, even if my sister always beats me
Love it. Completely addicting. Sucks when it force closes, though. :(
Scramble is a very addictive and a mind challenging game. But I have no complains about that. Other then what other people said, (which I have to agree with) I find this game fairly amusing and I recommend it to others. If you could fix the time to get a free coin to 5mins and not 20mins, and maybe add a practice mode that would boost my rating to five stars. Other then that I love it!!!
Addicting game that's good for your brain too
Best ever. Would like the option to play myself and get dome experience.
As always. Thank you Zenga
brainy fun, Awesome!
Really enjoy
Takes too long to reload coins.
Good
Not my favorite with friends game but i like to play it wen important bored.
Fun but frustrating waiting for tokens to play
Love the game but it freezes alot don't know if its my phone since it has  major problems or the game.  Samsung Galaxy
Fun game, no complaints
Jackie moon loves this game
Jackie moon loves this game
I enjoy this game lots!
Great game, love it. It's so addictive
Love it
Fun and addictive!
Great to play....just wish there was a day to cancel/dismiss unfinished games or terminate them after a certain amount of time has passed with no moves being made.
This game is addicting but the fact that we only get a token every 20 mins is bogus. I'm not going to pay money for tokens to play this game. I have more important things like kids to spend money on. I would get to play more often if I didn't have to wait for the tokens. In a pos note...I love the game.
Once you get good at this game, its a buzz. Great fun vs friends. Using HTC One
Zynga always has the best games and this one is no different.
Can't stop playing.
The pause is a bit delayed... all but one of the powers is useless... and the reset time on the coins could be a bit faster
really good game
Good stuff
This game is really good. The coins should be just for the game power-ups. That is my only complaint. Besides that, great and addictive game!
Great game just wish I could play alone sometime;)
I wish I could play against phone
I love this game I play it all the time. My only complaint is that there's a coin limit. You should at least be able to win some coins or even 1 for winning a game. That would make it allot more fun too.
pretty good for when your bored at work. just wish there was a computer to play against instead of waiting for someone to finish a round
Have problems with the game slowing during play, most times stopping.  Otherwise, great game to play with friends.
Love it!! Heaps fun!!
I absolutely love this game! Its highly addictive and it teaches me words! BUT I agree that there should be a shorter waiting period to get more coins. Other than that I love how the game matches me with random players at my current level.
Love this game im 100% addicted.!
Good game. I agree that the time frame for receiving coins should be lowered. That aside, god times.
Great.
Good
Great game!
Seems to run a little slow on my Android
The game is great, very similar to old games that were on some websites games channels years ago but playing against someone u know make it a lot better. The app is sometimes slow and glichy though.
Love this game
Fun
works good
This is very addicting
best words game ever
This game is so addicting and so much fun. Wish I could earn more coins tho.
fun
After ice cream sandwich sound seems to be quirky and skips. Kinda annoying. . Tho ice cream sandwich pretty much ruined my phone completely causing lags and other crap
Love it but would like the coins to only be used for power ups. Also, I think 2 mins is too fast. At least 3 mins like Boggle. Also skips some of my words.

The tokens suck!!
Love it
Burns battery. Need more coins.
Very good
Addictive & fun! The  complaints would have to be the amount of coins one gets! Why pay to get more coins if the game is "free"?!.. And I dont like that I have to wait 20 min. To get 1 coin back. Other than that.. Great game.
It does freeze a lot but it's really fun game.
Love this game! Very fun and quick. Only thing is it does freeze up at least once per game.
Love it! Except u cant wain coins and you have to wait forever to get them
This is a simple, fun and semi addicting game.
Great game love it
Great game love it
A lots of fun
Fun game, especially when you beat your mother in law!! LOL
...but just a new take on an old game. Play with someone with a good vocab and you will have tons more fun!
Can't stop playing! Love it!!
It's fun when you have someone to play and seeing how many words you can find.
Very addictive!!!! Can freeze up from time to time but overall, a great game.
Great game. Only problems are the occasional force close and screen freeze that keeps the clock running but will not allow you to play
Great game wish I could  play against the computer
Love this game!
Fun game very addictive. Big down, side this game freezes alot!
I love this game. I just wish it would actually scramble the letters. Scramble should actually mean scramble not rotate.
I feel like I am making the same words over and over sometimes. My only complaint.
Keeps your mind active!
I wish that there was a way to earn more coins, more games per day by playing.
Fun!
Quite addicting
Good challenging game...keeps your mind active and the eye hand coordination is a good way to spend game time, vocabulary and spelling are challenged...only draw back is the tokens..they go fast.
Super fun, and highly addictive. Hard to get the hang of, but once you've got it you wont want to stop!
Fun game!
Pretty fun I just don't like waiting for opponents
Best game ever
Woulda gave 5 stars but need a way to get coins for free!!! Takes 20 mins to get just 1 coin
Game
Works fine most of t the time fun game game crashes my phone occasionally
Love it!
Great game
Fun, fun, fun!  Did I mention fun?
Great game.
It's okay, but they could make it better
fun game!
Super fun. No bugs.
Love playing this...reminds me of playing BOOGLE as a kid! Occasionally has a problem and forces closed.
You should be able to see what helps the opponent uses.
Not bad. Keeps you on your toes!
very fun
Glad I was put on to this game....But now I'm ADDICTED!!! LOL
Freezes and lags on occasion but works for the most part. Awesome game. LG Optimus.
I think people are liars though..cuz I'm getting my butt handed to me regularly.
Luv the game but causes my phone to freeze
I am enjoying this games. Thumbs up.
Love this game... Coins go too fast... Sucks that you have to wait so.long for a club to.play but other than that love it!
Fun and addictive
Need more tokens to play
Nice quick game.
Great game..awesome fun playing wid frends...20 mins is way too long to wait for a coin, though!!
Fun game to play. I play against my hubby and its quite funny just how many words we both come up with that are different but we stay neck n neck on scoring.
I rate ut 4stars only because the game force closes so frequently otherwise it would be 5
Definitely fun and addicting!
Love it!
One of the best social game on smartphone! Had loads of casual yet competitive fun with family and friends. However I'm using S2 Gingerbread, and this game seems to eat up a huge chunk of my ram, it doesn't even free them up after exiting. Zynga PLEASE FIX THIS. Otherwise, 5 stars! Cheers
Would have given a 5 star if more gamers participated
The interface is a little confusing. I sometimes start games unintentionally and returning to the main menu after playing a round is also not clear cut.
Game freeze alot .. Lose time in the game.. Love the game overall..
very fun! :) Love it. But it keeps crashing on my Galaxy Ace and I had to keep taking out the battery and restart my hp....
Makes me want to go buy the real game. Just hate that you have to wait for tokens. Otherwise awesome.
Learning all kinda of new words while trying to compete with my friends.
Love it!!  Very addicting...The only negative is it causes my android phone to freeze once in a while.
I love it except for we should get more tokens in a time frame less than 20 mins per token.
Fun games, fast game works great!
I get bored very easily as well as the fact that i use games to fall asleep. I love this and my other zynga mobile apps. Only possible issue I see is that some people, like myself only play once a week.
Love it
Fun game it shoulkd just have mmore coins for more games
Love this game... Very addicting.. Wish you could earn stars with every win.
It'saddicting!!
Goof game
It takes time to become creative with words but you'll get out
I love this gameeee! the only thing is you have to wait a few minutes until you get your coins.
So far so great.
Awesome
Great fun great up date.
Great game, fast, fun and love to beat my wife.   Wished the coins came faster.
Likes the game
Can't get tired of this game!! Very good!!
Whole family enjoys the game
Pretty cool
Coins should be given when you win. We certainly see enough ads!
Love the game ....need coins a little faster
Helps to pass the time with friends.
Fun game sometimes freezes up but over all I like the game....
Great
Wish u did not have to use tokens to play each game,
****
Love the game but what's up with lack of opportunity to play?  You can run out of tokens or simply Max out opponents which is so frustrating.  Why not just let us play when and as long it is convenient for us?
Great, it's just like boggle but with more points. Just wish there was a way to check definitions at the end of the game
No complaints. Good time killer
Love it
It is a good game. Well worth downloading.
It freezes to much for me
Freezes lot but awesome game
Great game live it freezes some time but all you together great.
Fun game very addictive just wish that you got coins faster & you could what ever inspirations that u wanted.
Love this game!
I am still a little slow, but still love the challenge, when I play random opponents.
Love this game. Very addictive. Also, love the update.
Love the game but I have one question:  sometimes there is a speech bubble over the game.  It is NOT a conversation with my opponent because when I check the conversation there is nothing.  Can someone please explain because this happens a lot.
Love the game but It would be nice if you won something like more coins as a reward for winning so that you can play more
Just which u could play as one player
Great game..
Sometimes it runs kind of slow... but this game is addicting!!!!
Love the app! The coin thing stinks tho! Idk why they make you have to complete the purchase thru Google Wallet, it doesn't work! GW doesn't have a supported app on most Android phones. If you can't get into the app from your phone, you can't obtain a GW "Pin", therefore rendering it a useless effort to purchase more coins! Make your Entire app support all the devices that can download it, have an alternate chkout method, GW doesn't work on a wide range of devices.
So addictive! I love this game
Its fun it just freezes a lil bit but its still fun
Good but freezes
Love this game.
For the most part, it is a fun game. Sometimes it seems like the game cannot keep up with the speed of my finger. Lol. So,  it has locked up on me a few times.
I can't get enough of this game. I love playing all the time.
Love it! Wish the coins didnt take 20min a piece though! No other complaints
Very addictive,competitive helps pass the time
Fun and enjoyable game but the token system is quite outrageous and limits you from playing
Awesome. I don't know why there's a need to earn coins though. Kind of lame- I'd play a lot more if I didn't need to wait for coins.  Otherwise I highly recommend :)
Love This Game!!!
Fun!
Fun and addicting game!
Great game but wish i didnt have to wait so long for tokens
Never give a 5...
I love this game
Nice time killer. coin generation is a bit slow. Too many ads :-(
If it kept records I would give it a 5
Good
Good game. Would be better without coins and power ups.
Great game! Brain teaser and great competition
Great and addicting game. Don't like waiting for the coins to refill to play but its better than paying for the coins. It would b nice if we can cancel games with players who are not active.
Players should be dropped if they don't move within three days.If u are at your limit and u have people holding your play up its really frustrating.
Love it!
Love this game.... Great for kids, and adults
Will not let me login anymore... please fix! Username is #STEELERSNATION
it's awesome but u hav 2 coins
This game is addictive!
Its a good game I enjoy it.
Love it!
Great Game
Love playing this game, once u start u just cant stop
Its ok no problems so far
Love this game! A cool combination of Scrabble and Boggle. I would like to have more time per round. I often get caught at the end of a round when I still see many more words.
Fun game
Fun game
It's awesome
Highly addictive game, I enoy it very much. Like someone else mentioned I wish there was a practice mode you could play without having to wait on an opponent.
Great game guys!
Doesn't let you delete inactive games and a few other bugs. Otherwise great and super addictive games.
A fun game to play with friends. Only disappointment is that you don't earn free coins every 20 mins if you've bought coins, if you've got more than 15 left, then you don't earn freebies.
Truly entertaining app. Lots o'fun and very user friendly. Free app so no way I could bash the game but... would easily rate it 5 stars if coin regeneration time was lowered, say to 10 minutes instead of current twenty minutes in between coins. I know that developer would like some revenue and it is worth purchasing the extra coins but I would enjoy quicker coin transfer. Aside from this the game is a definite KEEPER.
Continuously played this for months. Simple game but great
Would hv been better with move to sd card feature and low memory usage
YYYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I love this game. Wish I can play myself when waiting on others ...
I really enjoy playing this. I even have my little one hooked :)
I like it I just wish I had the option to play constantly and with an opponent
Great game...just hate the limits.
Just don't like the whole coin thing, I always have to wait so long to get more coins and I'm not buying any either.
I really like this game/app but I hate how I run out of coins and I cant play any more at all...unless I buy coins. Dislike!
FUN.
Its fun..works well
See above
Fun!!!
Fun but needs. More coins   !
I really enjoy playing. Need to add coins faster though. Hate waiting for coins to refill.
Good game good fun will keep you coming back for more...
Love this game
Very fun and worth downloading!
Awesome
Freezes my phone from time to time but worth it.
One of my favorites!!!
its fun, quick and easy.
Its very nice to play on my samsung transform ultra especially after the last update great to kill time just sometimes your opponents take too long to play
Its very nice to play on my samsung transform ultra especially after the last update great to kill time just sometimes your opponents take too long to play
Love this game for the most part...except for the slight delay sometimes.
Fun and engaging. I wish u didn't have to play according to a coin system, which needs to be replenished with money when used up.
Game works great.  It runs smooth, workable graphics, and rarely crashes.
Fun to play with friends, great competition and challenging.
Great fun. Fast pace
Loads of fun, easy to play.
Wish I could play against a computer sometimes.
I love this game!
I love it
Great game, although frustrating when my sister keeps thrashing me! Wish it had a practice option so you don't have to keep starting new games just to practice. Otherwise would have given 5 stars.
Just  a little repetitive
Good game, but on Samsung Galaxy Ace is continues to freeze or the screen will go black. I then have to tak my battery out and start my phone out again. It would be 5/5 if it was fixed :)
Love the game....addictive
I love it!
I love the game it is really addictive only complaints if someone is waiting for you it only remind you once
great game
Finding this one particularly addictive.
This game I just love!  I just wish it would be a little easier for beginners.  Because in the beginning it's just really hard for people who have never played it before  to get the hang of it. Maybe they could have it get harder as you progress in the game. I think definitely get the free version. It's just not worth  it to pay  $1 for a game when there's practically no difference between it and the free version which is just as good. Over all great game with 1 flaw!
Love the game.  So addicting.
Little freezing up but it's amazing
Older so I dont think as fast but fun and stimulating.
Don't like having to have tokens to play
V
This app is really fun
It needs unlockables like Hanging With Friends does. Leveling up, or something like that, would be cool. Game is a 5 for its gameplay but overall I will go with a 4 because theres always room to improve. I plan to change it to 5 in the future.  :)
Fun
Love playing this game. I don't like waiting for coins.
Great game.
Its a fun game!!
Great fun
The game lags a lot and takes quite some time to start up. Sometimes it freezes in the middle of a game, which is quite irritating.
Addicted. Wish there was a way 2 play alone 2 practice or get  extra coins when win.	Otherwise enjoy.
Great game! I bought coins but I feel I should still collect free coins when I have waited the 20 minute refresh period. Maybe divide them into groups so you know how many free coins you have vs paid coins.
It's a lot of fun but asking you to pay for tokens is ridiculous. They make you watch the stupid ads anyway. Need play CPU option.
great game, lots of fun & a little thought process
This is a fun game. I wish there was a way to practice.  4/5
Addictive.. have had it six months and still play everyday!!!
Awesome, ocassional crashes though
Love it!
I play my girlfriend. She beats me pretty bad sometimes ... but I'm getting better. She is a lot smarter than me though.
Awsum, addictive playing  Be. nice to play solitary like we used to play long ago.
Fun app
I agree with other users - you should be able to cancel games against non-responsive user much sooner. (like within 3 days vs the current 7 days) Also I think the player with the highest score at the end of the game should win a few coins - it'd be good incentive for people to finish games. And anyone who is the victim of a non-responsive player should receive the cons back they wasted against that player.
Love it! So addicting only downfall is all the pop up ads.....otherwise super fun!
How I wish I cld just play alone. It's a long wait for another player at times.
Love this game but it can take several days to complete. Once you make a move, the person you play against may take several days to make their move so I get fed up and resign the game
Good game!!!
You'll be obsessed.
Great game. Addictive
Fun game. Took one star off for crashing a lot, even when I'm not in the program. But it's an easy fix, just say yes to force close and try again.
Great game but needs personnel stats ie games won/lost.
Sometimes no sound
Highly addictive...when it workS :(
Making chat easier would be a nice touch for a "5" from me
Terrible. Worst lagging game pin google play
Besides the force closing it is an ok game ..
great game.
This game is addictive
Pity it takes so long between turns. Works well, no issues.
A good game that makes you think and it helps to pass the time!
I play every chance I get. I wish there were a way to earn more time per game.
Lots of ads...but very addicting
Makes you think alot and know how to spell fun game over all.
A really awesome game to play when you're bored! I haven't had any problems with it.
I don't really understand the coins, etc but it's a fun game.
More coin allowance please
Fun game. But the lag time is unreal. Whether its loading or in the middle of game play. The game can't keep up. Please fix
Good
Couldn't open at all today!
El juego esta súper entretenido.
This is a fun game...love the new option hope they keep it as an option
This game is GARBAGE!  Been waiting for a long time for an update so this game wouldnt screw my phone.  Got the update and no improvement.  I hope this game and its creators get herpes... Droid X2
Fun game but...waiting for players to take their turn sucks.
Its a pretty ok game...
love it! great brain exercise!
My limit is two games at a time.  Because after that my phone (Galaxy Ace) freezes and it's really tedious to take out the back cover and pull out the battery EVERY SINGLE TIME.  It's a shame because this game is so addicting, but that's what is stopping me from giving this app five stars.
Love the game my only complaint is that you can't keep playing with new players. Once you hit your max you, can't add new players even if the players that you've played with at least once who don't want to continue to play  -  you can't delete those dormant players.
Too laggy.. better the winner get an award such extra coins.. or summary of games with the opponent. But this game is addictive
Fun to play.  A lot of the same words are played in each game.  Power ups are fun too.
Super fun and addictive - I spend too too much time playing it in 1 thing I really like about it is at least the free version you can play if you run out of coins - probably to prevent repetitive motion injury suits.
Improving my vocabulary as well...the downside is that players hv to wait 20mins to get 1token...
Very addictive
Love it
Its fun and a Herat game when your Bored
Its fun and a Herat game when your Bored
Very fun and addicting game
I love this game, but its stealing time and constantly freezing. Other than that a very wonderful and addictive game to play.
Fun but frequently having to "force close".
This is a pretty good game, although the coin limitations on gameplay are annoying, if you are hardcore and cheap, avoid this game
game its fun. it would be nice if the coins were faster.
Sometimes my opponents 2nd game is skipped.
Best game ever!
Games r good but the ads after every round r ridiculous. Especially the video ones.
Games r good but the ads after every round r ridiculous. Especially the video ones.
I love this game!!!
sometimes it crashes but for the most part it's pretty fun
Great, addicting game just wish u got coins faster... *thats my only complaint*
Fun and challenging!
I love it. Wish it had a solo mode u could play while u wait for your tokens
good game. keeps your brain going.
good game. keeps your brain going.
good game. keeps your brain going.
Its addicting. Love it !!! But does crash alot on my tablet and my galaxy phone
A few bugs but overall a good time
this game is well designed and addictive... I do wish they would give you a practice mode and daily bonus for spelling certain words.... the game crashes much less after updating to ice cream sandwich
Very addictive.
Would like to see the ability to accumulate more coins.  Also be able to play solo.
When I play this game I get an average of 165 points, when other people play me they get between 235-255 points but I don't consider myself thick!?
Great game when it works properly. Occasional freezes, and need to purchase coins to play a bit annoying. The coin cycle time is a bit too high, and the ads are a little much, still a great game though!
So far its fun, I keep hoping I'll get better...
This game is super fun great way to pass the time
This game is super fun great way to pass the time
Love it all.  Only complaint is that I wish I could delete or resign from unfinished games when opponent doesn't play and its not my turn.
5 stars if they removed the ads.  Highly addictive.
Except for the wait to get tokens....this game can get you going..........
So fun! Love this game. Just wish you could get coins to play quicker.
Love it!
It' s just fun
Awesome and addictive. Would have given 5 stars if it weren't for the coins. It slows the game play down have to wait for coins to play.
This game is great!
love it..
Love it! I wish there was a single player mode. I agree with comment below i wish you could exit the game without affecting your score when others are not playing
Lots of fun, but pauses at the most inopportune times :-(
A little more time wouldn't hurt. ; )
Automatically signes me out every time I end the app
Please make a single player mode so users can play all they want.....would actually buy coins for that!!!!  Great game but for that one thing.
Please make a single player mode so users can play all they want.....would actually buy coins for that!!!!  Great game but for that one thing.
I enjoy playing....
I love this game
I love this game
Very fun game, it works my brain but its really slow the more people you play and I have to do the option whole set up twice before I play because it keeps going back. Also I dont like how you can invite someone to play again and they can too...good game tho
Fun
Love it
I enjoy this game keeps my mind fresh.
Better than words with friends. Lots of fun!
Great game.....would love to have free coins offer sooner.
Great game.  The only problem is some people quit playing in the middle of a game ( I am NOT talking about resigning - they just don' t finish the game).  The result is that I can only play a couple of games while I wait for these games that were not completed to be removed by the company (some of these games have been stopped for over 7 days).  I cannot start new games until these games in limbo go away.
Need to add more grids with different letter layouts. I play so much that i swear i've seen some of the same layouts several times.
Fun, fast, and easy! A great way to play.
Love this game so addicting! Please put a practice or solo mode would love that! And it looks like I'm not the only one. It would be a 5 with that.
Just wish u could play more games at once, delete games when ur waiting too long, and accrue more coins in a shorter period. Other than that, lotsa fun! :-)
Good
Lots of fun!
Great game!!!
Fun game to play against people you do and don't know. App itself works fine. Slows down the phone a little but nothing major.
Its gd fun...it has been my old time favorite game...me n my son both enjoy it....
I love this game! Hate when my coins run out. Ugh. Overall WONDERFUL
Addictive game
Fun game!! Its just like boggle!!
I love playing this game very much. A lot of fun plus a good way to pass time by.
Good game lots of fun very fast
Great game the coins just limit your play
Needs more tokens
Great game, gave it four stars because i think it needs a practice round...
I'm really enjoying this game just hate the limited play tokens.
Very fun and instantly addictive. Be sure to get your tokens.
Play with friends to pass da time. Nvr win but still. Nvr play against ur girlfriend or a teacher, u nvr win.... -_-
Can't stop playing. I wish the bonuses didn't use coins though.
Love it!
Great game I like that you don't have to wait forever for someone to play its fun
Just wish there were more tokens! :(
Great game n addicting! Just one change that will make it better.. The winner of the whole match should win at least an automatic 2 coins to continue playing, winners shouldn't have to wait the whole day to play :)
Have a great time playing against my kids! learning and it's so fun! Fun competition with each other. Some lag in game otherwise it would be a five.
Easy
Good game but freezes too frequently.
I am personally against any "cheat" or help features.
Fun.. Addictive.. Would like if the scramble help would mix the letters better than flipping them
Love it!
Love the game dont like how long it takes to get new coins..but the game is very fun
Don't understand the script with the coins......pointless!
Love this game!
Need more players!!
Very addicting, love playing this game with my friends
Very addicting, love playing this game with my friends
This game is addictive.  I enjoy playing with people I don't know & retaining anonymity.  Also, the fast pace makes the game thrilling and fun.  I'd love a challenge round forcing players to step their game up & winners should get some bonus coins!
Pretty cool idea very user friendly app.
Super fun!
This game is lots of fun. Can be difficult to deal with small letters/buttons on phones; but is great for tablets. Love it.
It's quick, fun, and challenging. If you like Words with Friends or Scrabble you'll like this too.
Only wish I could see a list of words I've played during the timed game, not just afterwards.

Addicting! <3 love it! But freezes up my phone. !
The only problem I have with this game is waiting 20mins for one token :-(
The game is great.....hut it keeps locking up my phone...wth?
Great game
Get to learn new vocabs Surplus use brains  Fun nd best for tp
This game is so adicting!!
My mom always plays and she got me hooked on it!! Lol
Just like boggle. The ads suck. Can be kind of slow too.
Addictive, very fun but I gave it 4 stars because it causes my phone to lag :(
Does not always notify you when it is your turn.
I love playing this game. I can play games with my friends and my relatives who live far await. It keeps us in touch.
This game is fun and challenging. I just wish it was a version you can play alone.
With only 3 rounds you must be super quick. Though Playing at your own pace for this kind of game is not really my idea of fun, totally worth downloading
I really like this game but it wont connect with my Facebook friends so im waiting forEver for any random opponent ...????
Great game but too many of same letters in every puzzle
Love this game just wish  you didjt have to wait for new coins and more words were accepted
What a great game for long trips.
5 stars if have more free coins!
Great app to link up with family & friends for some educational fun. Should allow (1) player practice mode though.
LOVE THE GAME. WORKS GREAT ON PHONE.
This is a really fun, fast-paced word game. Only problem is that you only have a certain amount of coins and you need coins to play. After playing 3 rounds, you have to wait an hour a half to play another round.
Lots of fun
not bad..but can get slightly tedious
It lags or freezes now and then
I'm a beginner at playing this game but it's lots of fun. Keeps you alert and increases sharpness! Try it you'll like it!
Very addictive, keeps me up all night
Addictive...beware!!  :) just wish I could find the rules again
Fun, but the coins are annoying
Its a wonderful game ,but its hard to figure out hhow to end a game you dont won't to play anymore
....few, if any, technical shortcomings. But beware, as it's so addicting it can easily take over your life!
Gets the brain worling
I like it
Simply a delight to play I just wish the coins were giving out in a shorter time period instead of the time set. Besides that I have no problems with the game its good to play against my friends so I get bragging rights.
this game is fun & addicting! im hooked. bad thing is...when you have too many games open & when there are games where the opponents clearly aren't going to play when its been a week or so since you joined the game. I can't get it to let me quit it! needs to be fixed!
Really fun game although it freezes up while I try to make words and causes me to get low score
Addictive. Love it.
It would be five if I was better at it!
Would b better if u didn't have to use coins to play a game, just for the extras...seems frivolous...
Fast and fun game to play. Would give 5 star if players are allowed to cancel games that are waiting too long.
Love this game.
I really enjoy playing this game! I wish they would allow you to cancel games you start with friends that don't play you back or lift the limits on games you can start. My game is full of rounds waiting for people to play their turn and I can't start any new games. We should be able to cancel rounds that have been sitting there for days. No fun when I can only play a couple rounds a day.  Also I wish they had a practice mode so you could just play for fun while waiting on friends to play their turn.
Just hate having to wait on games...can't have it all.
Only problem is it freezes..
Very addictive
Game keeps crashing with latest update
If you give coins when you win a round ill change it to 5 stars
Fun game!!
Would be five but you need to wait for or buy coins to play. That should only be for the items. Pretty annoying.
I love this game! So glad to learn we can resign a game in progress since some players are so nasty. I wish they'd up the number of games we can start, all in all, I love it though!
Will you remove that irritating F1 William's racing game ads from the middle of the screen please?
Adrenalin pumping
Love this game!
Wish u could delete games when people dont play but otherwise loads of fun. Like Boggle
Fun!
Would b really awesome if they added sum more words.....but its extremely addictive & if i didn't have a job i would play it all day!!!!:-)
So amusing, easy to use. Only problem is those stupid coins you have to use to play.
No issues not too addicting nice to come back to every once and a while
Fun to play
Good game
I have the free version and the one I paid for and there is no difference in the ads.... Frustrating...... Also there is one particular ad that I can't even get out of....... Please fix this.... On a positive note..... The game is one of the best out there!!
Addicting
the Greatest
Loves me some scramble
i love this game it is addicting....:)
I luv this game!
My fav new game.  Tokens are a pain.
Awesome just another good game too play with friends
This game is fantastic! I would only change one thing, i think that if you win you should be able to earn more coins. Besides that, this game is really fun!
Game is fun but need more than 2 minutes
give more coins
Would be better if there was a single player mode instead of constant online.  Make that happen and 5 stars are yours Xx Ps. Works brilliantly on my S2 Xx
It is a fun game with no pesky ads. Its really cool to play on an Android phone because you can glide over the letters.
Wish it didnt have to use coins to play....using coins to but the hints is ok but just to play sux.....but overall its a fun game
Love it....addictive stuff !
Love this game! Just wish you didn't need coins to play!
Fun game good concept.
Could use some extra coins..
Love it.  Would have given 5 stars but sometimes causes phone to lock up.
Great Game.
Love this game. Does hang now and then when playing fast. Besides that really enjoy. Thanks
This game is probably the most fun game i've played on the market, everytime i run it it causes my phone to be extremely laggy.  The only way to get it to start working correctly is to do a battery pull.  Taskkillers help the lag, bu they dont completely get rid of it.  I also can only do a round or 2 before the lag gets so bad that my round clock goes from like a minute left then lags out and the round is over.  It is so frustrating at times to deal with, but when it is running good,this is by far the best
Fun keeps the mind sharp
Love this game so quick. Very enjoyable
Good game play quick and controled kept the fifth star because it takes 1 day to find an opponent and another day to wait for them to take their turn maybe try a group room dinamic so play isn't based on if they are paying attention or not
Works well!
No tokens would be better because or atleast play alone for free or else this app is excellent
I get impatient waiting for people to move!
Love this game....needs more words though
Add me for games.. app is great but i hate that u have 2use ur coins for games and it takes a while 2 get coins back
Love the game but sometimes it freezes
Great way to pass the time. Helps sharpen your spelling skills & makes you think about words with more than for letters.
Good game helps burn time
Boggle anywhere without the noisy shake of cubes
Good game.
Lots of fun...
Glad resign was added. Still hate the coin system. Overall it's still fun & addictive
Wish we didn't need coins but really fun and challenging.
Slows down and freezes phones a lot
I really like this, I play against my family and friends. Loving it. :-)
Love to ply this game
The app is engaging and user-friendly. I haven't experienced any problems using it.
Fun
I love this game.
It would be cool if you could just play the game by yourself. Like words with friends pass and play.
Good game however does not update games fast enough
It force closes most of the time.. please fix.. thank you! :)
Fun game I play with my husband great fun
I keep getting my butt kicked, but it's still a lot of fun.
Awesome game!!!
Excellent time killer but need to kill the ads pls..
I like it cause its a quick game doesn't take much time. It keeps ya thinking!
Scoring is not right. Had a word shuda been 21pts only gave me 3. Tried to report but help is an endless maze of options...will give 5 stars again when fixed.
I really enjoy this game but no one wants to play with me because I always win (almost) lol
The most addictive word game I have played. Only please come up with a pass to player game mode.  If you do that then I rate it 5.
No problems. Fun game but kind of gets old. Prefer words with friends over this but still a good game.
Addictive. Would be great to be able to resign opponents who dont take their turn within a few days. Or have the ability to begin more games, the ceiling on number of gamea started is low esp.when you're waiting on opponents to complete a.game.

Needs to accept more words...then a five.  But overall awesome game.
Love this game!! However, letters are not being mixed up in games. I keep getting the same letter grid every few games. It would be so much better if it allowed more game play! 5 tokens is crazy!!! Id play nonstop if I could, but then there r the tokens
Love the game, my only complaint is that it always crashes in the middle of a game and then the timer resets and I can't remember words I've already done. Done it 3 times now on my current game (Galaxy S2)
FUN!!
Great game but waiting for coins SUCKS!
Fun To Play! But Force Closes Way Too Much. PLEASE Fix It :)
I like the game a lot, too bad it freezes on me mid game
It's very fun and there no spam interruping the game  witch make it way more fun
I'm not really digging the update. When the letters light up I lose concentration
brilliant      but very frustrating
Dont like the coins but it's a great game
Great game but loading gets slow at times.
Works great on my EVO 3D. If you love Boggle than you'll love this. My only complaint would be that I wish that would give you more varied boards, maybe one where there is only 100 words to find as opposed to 300. Would make it more interesting, and more like real Boggle.
would like a better march making and a friends list
I like this game but would like it more if at the 10 second mark my perks don't bounce. They are hard to click on. I also wish that while using the perks it would change the first tiles color yo easily find the starting point.
Good relaxing game.
Fun game .
Superb game but it is now force closing and working really slow.  Even with full service.  Please fix and thank you.
Not to bad. The coins are kinda bull, but besides that, it great!
Love it
Frustrating, but good fun !
It's pretty fun I guess..
It does seem to drain my phone's power really fast though
Pretty cool concept, I like it so far!
LoL would rate higher if I got higher scores... ;)
Fun game!
why my s3 cannot login with facebook account?
I like this even better than the popular "words" game!!
It crashes all the time :-(
Fun but can't start over 21 games and nobody plays with you!!!
Fun but can't start over 21 games and nobody plays with you!!!
Good fun. Never can beat anyone though.
It makes my system slow !
Very fun
This app has improved but the lag time between clicking on the app and seeing the game screen is a bit annoying
Great game
I would have given 4 stars, but it keeps freezing on my Samsung  galaxy S2.
Solid game
5 stars when you can view your stats vs. other players wins losses etc
Cool! I am enjoying this game. I love the new update.
Fun and easy but quite slow to load
Too many "forced close" issues, often does not register selection, slow to load. I love the concept and was a favorite, but recent upgrades are a step in the wrong direction IMO.
Awesome game
Fun game but once ya get into it ya have to stop and wait for coins... annoying
Luv it
Even though I'm not winning as often as I'd like too, this game is still fun and a challenge.  So.....I am lovin it!!  Also, after reading the other reviews, I must add that I'm glad the coins run out because it makes me take the needed break! Then I come right back at it again!
The coins are annoying. The game is fun.
Addictive and fun. Not fond of running out of tokens so quick
I love this game. Have updated my score to 4 stars now than either player can resign from games that are unfinished.
Enjoy this game. I use to like words with friends, but I like the appeal and the timed moves.
Though it is free...more coins cost money.
The tokens thing is a little annoying, but other than that a very addictive fun game!!
Love this game... But I hate it when the letters stick! Sometimes it's hard to find players!
I enjoy this game
Great game however it freezes my phone
I absolutely love love love this game! The only thing is that I wish there were more coins they game you before having to pay for them.
Not quite boggle but it's an enjoyable word game.
This game is pretty fun to play when you have some free time
Great app tat let us hav much more intimate r/s w frenz! ;)
The tokens are silly. And the game has a few glitches. But i love boggle and this is really fun.
like it a lot wish they would give more coins
Cool game but i wish i can just play by itself without inviting friends...
Ok
Ever since my stepmum showed this game to me I loved it! But the only thing is that I wish there was some way to play with a computer or something because it gets tiring and boring having to wait for your friends to do their move. Good game overall.
the game is quick and can be played at ur leisure
Wish there was a way to play solo to get practice.
Wish there was a way to play solo to get practice.
My only issue is the token situation.
Love the game but gave it a 4 because sometimes it sticks. Not sure if its the game or my phone...but hasn't stopped me from playing!
UPDATE:  Upgrades seem to have fixed most of the problems. Still slows down now and then, but at least I can play!   Takes forever to finish one game because I can't ever play. As soon as I hit "play" the game freezes and has to close.
Hours of fun
I like it
would give this a five star but as u have to use a coin to play and its hard to get more im ratin it lower . but otherwise its brilliant xxxx
Game is great gets a little glitchy with me but works fine most of the time.
@Spankdungz
Love the game Boggle and this app brings back some good memories.  I like playing against others but this would also be fun with a solo approach of trying to improve one's score.
This game is really fun and fast paced however sometimes just closes on its own
Still fun thou, wish they had better hints and tips thou, like I said I'm not that good
No app is perfect so i give four stars. Maybe you could have a tournament mode or something. Awesome app though :)
I can't get enough! :-)
Dope!
Love the game. The only fault I found is that I take some words as new and the score is increased for that but those will be already marked by me
Hours of fun!
Love this game. Have been playing nonstop from day to night. A fun game to pass the time especially when you're bored and has nothing better to do.
I'd give this game 5 stars, but you need to use coins for every turn! And it takes 20 mins to get a new coin, unless you want to buy more...I think coins should be used in case you want extra power ups, not just to take a turn. Otherwise great game!
Really fun game. Challenges your brain just a little and keeps you busy at the same time.
The game itself is amazing...its just that sometimes it makes my phone freeze and then it turns off
Great game!
Love love love the game, but the freezing up is very frustrating. Please fix this problem. I have to remove my battery and power up again to get it to work.
Good game but wish u could make it go faster.
It's so fun a lot like boggle but with an interesting twist
I love it but words r repetative n it slows my phone down.
The game is really fun and enjoyable but it crashes on me about once a day.
I really love the game.
Enjoyable and easy to use
Limited open games and can't dismiss games which the opponent never play.
One pf the best I have played yet!!
Love the game. Just hate that I can't keep playing unless u buy more tokens. :(
It's fun to play keep u bush for awhile just wish they had more u could do if u win but other then that it was great
Great time killer!
Nice game, but abit repeatitive
I absolutely luv, luv, luv this game! The only thing that I don't like is that u need tokens to actually play. That, in my opinion, should b changed.
I miss when the words would highlight green when you got a word, but otherwise I love the game!
A few odd words are missing (as in words with friends) and rare crashes, but otherwise very enjoyable.
A few odd words are missing (as in words with friends) and rare crashes, but otherwise very enjoyable.
I love this game! No problems so far...
Want to play more but the coins run out to quickly.
Great game.
This game is addictive! - On the downside, having to wait for tokens is annoying and a pass n play option would be great but love it otherwise.
Absolutely luv the game but the tokens r annoyin!
Sound was buggy. Now off. Wiped out all sounds on Samsung GII. Have to exit via tasks to get it back. Otherwise fun to play.
Fun
Awesome very challenging
It's fun, addictive, and very competitive, but I'll worn other users of Galaxy S II's, it hogs memory (on every phone), but can also shut off your sound for no reason.. But the solution to that glitch seems to be to use the task manager, go to the "RAM" section, and hit clear. Then after about 10 seconds, it should be fine. Other than that, it's a fun game that I would probably recommend.
Just use game to keep the brain active. Have fun with friends in the process.
Need to show how many bonuses opponent is using
Addicting .. super fun.. some words that scramble accepts are questionable .. but overall a great game and good to exercise brain muscles :)
Really like this one. I hardly ever win against most my friends. But learning new words & techniques to finding words every time i play.
its addictive. run
This is a fun game, you can have fun trying to win and learn lol
So far :)
Needs a pass and play, but other than that, great game!
I love this anxiety producing game!
Love this game but it freezes and randomly closes at times!!
Addicted!
Thanks for adding the nudge... How about if you just want to play and can't find anyone you give an option to play the computer... If you win a game you get to keep coins spent to play as a bonus so you can keep playing... Just a thought;-)
I love this game its so much fun and i like competing with my friends and co workers! Love that you can find others to play with aswell great game overall..also works perfect on my galaxy sII.
fun but sometimes runs a little slow on droid x
Not really sure about the coin system, but this is a fun game!
it a great game but it keeps force closing on me.
Fun challenging friends or anyone.
Why token?? Or else cut short the waiting time, others are best!
great game because it helps build more word knowledge and memory.
Great game
Great game
Game is pretty Kool..
It is good since most my friends live somewhere else
Fun game. Works great!
I love this game! It would be better if you could delete games people dont finish & should get more tokens quicker
I love the game but what's the reason for the coins to play?  I feel like I'm playing a jukebox or an arcade game.  Just when I get in a heated showdown I have to wait to have enough coins to play and power up.  I would like to be able to earn coins with sessions achieving a certain point or word level.  At least you feel like you are working toward more than one goal.
I looove this game. BUT, it freezes my tablet and gets "laggy" after a few rounds. I have to reboot or go under settings, running apps, and hit stop... Then reopen the app to start playing again.  It is by far my favorite game, so I am wiling to do this, but pleeeease fix asap! Samsung Galaxy 7" tablet.
Love this game.
The updates are cool.
Love this game...
The game is really addicting, but the facebook syncing doesn't always seem to work.
Hate the coins though
Very addictive and a good way to put your mind in action need more friends :)
But would love to play more than one or two games here & there.... coins need to restock quicker!
if only getting tokens was easier...like they could be banked.  otherwise it's a great game!!
Everythingis good, but sound is disappear without any adjust.i enjoy playing this game
Playing all the time. My only complaint is some times it shuts itself off in midplay.....lose my concentration when I am on a roll!
Very fun
I would give it 5 stars if they had single player (me) instead of having to find someone!
Great game for Word lovers.
But I don't like that you run out of coins and have to wait to play again :(.... Wish they would fix that.
LOVE IT!
The game us fun, but i have been matched with a partner whose name is racially offensive!!!! This is a public company and needs to screen names. I am appauled.
Love the game wish there was more time to find words
Love it , only wish it didn't take so long to get more coins. Otherwise its an awesome game !
If you enjoy word games such as scrabble boggle or upwords, this is the ultimate game for you. What's even more fun is you need to actually play with someone!
Great game
Good mind exercise,very fun !!
Although its been freezing lately, its a real fun game and I love it!
Easy to play, fun game.
Would give 5 stars if didn't have to use coins for rounds
Really good app and it's lots of fun. Would have given it five stars if it didn't take so long to search for an opponent.
I have found it is a bit of a drain on the battery though!
Works great nexus s
Just wish smart match was faster
great game am totally hooked!!!
Love it!!!
Really good fun very addictive!!
Just wish the freezes would be fixed for the LG Thrill. But, love it!
Love it!! Except I'm playing people who get 200 points while I'm getting 500 lol
It is helpful for memory, and just for fun
Very good game. Don't by the tokens. Still a good game.
Good fun on the go and very addictive. Fun to compete with friends too!!
Very good game! Download
Makes u proper think
Love the game . I'm new at it and my friebds beat the snot out of me but I love it.
A fun word scramble game. Wish it would let you delete a game if an opponent takes too long to play, though.
Great game love it
Its a great way to spend game time with friends and family.
So much fun, but if u play too many games in a row, it gets overloaded and slows down, and eventually forces close
I love this game very addictive just wish that it could be played alone or against the computer when there's no one rose to play with
Fun fast paced game
I really enjoy the game. I hope that there would be new power ups aside from the usual one.Thanks developers
Need wait for coins,no bonus when highest score,always no response,no gain for frequent player,no word explanation,but still good fun game.
Allow player to resign If the other player dun respond for more than a week.
This game is fun and super addictive the only thing that sucks is you have to pay a coin  each time to play and it takes 20 min just to get one coin. That's kinda dumb youshould get coins for winning then it would be better. For now 4 stars.
Very addicting lots of fun delay is annoying.
I'm an addict.
I love this game and have to use all my tokens before I stop playing.  The only thing I dont like is ocassionally it doesnt give me tokens like its supposed to do.  I used all my tokens about 2 hrs ago and all I've earned is one token.
Fun!
Easy to play. Fast games. Lots of fun.
Its a fun game although it wont except some words but will except all the swear words LOL
My htc Sensation 4G dies quickly when playing.  Sometimes gets so hot I have to pull the battery out.  But, It's a great game!
Great game, though I feel the words are repetitive.
ID PREFER TO NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR COINS!  OTHER THAN THAT ITS FUN!
Liver that I can play with friends and family! Game lags a little but still fun!
Addictive!!!
We got coins for finishing games and/or winning.  Addictive, fun, challenging :)  Wish it didn't cost for extra coins.  Works great on Droid 4 and Acer Iconia Tab.
Freezes a decent amount but it's worth it, the game is a lot of fun.
LOVE IT! JUST DON'T LIKE THAT I CAN ONLY PLAY WHEN I HAVE ENOUGH COINS.. :+)
A great mind/brain activity - the only reason it lost 1 star is i want the option to play without the timer, if we had that option, i could easily give this 5 stars
Great to play with my friend from many miles.away. Hasn't crashed either.
love it but would be good if you got tokens as reward for winning
Nyc
I looove this game, but it tends to freeze
Ok game. Not bad
I'm so addicted to this game!!!! I really love the challenge of it.
I love scrambler!! Awesome game to pass the time.
Nice game, very fun.
Why can't these 'with friends' developers figure out a way to get a game going with more than one other friend?
I like playing when I have nothing better to do
Fun game to play with your kids
Need to have a delete for people who are not playing
Great game! i love it....But I also think that we should get a free coin for every game we win..and wait less time for a new coin cuz 20 mins can be a long wait..
I like to play it.
good! a little slow for droids.
Wish I could play more, but I always running out of tokens! I hate waiting for them to accumulate!
great game
Great game
Works great
Fun game but don't like having to wait for coins.  If you could shorten the time to 3-5 minutes that would make it more enjoyable.
i do absolutely love this game! i wish there was a way . to play on my own instead of waiting for my opponents to get back to the game. but instead of that, love this game!
Def a fun game. Just wish if u won the overall game that u could win a coin bc its like u play for nothing bc u win nothing and each round to play costs a coin. Kind of lame but overall a fun game! You guts should fix that so we win something like hanging with friends! More coins please without paying for them. Thanks
love the game just hate that the application slows my whole phone down
Fun
*AlciJill* my username. Play against me
Awesome game to play. Wish there was a way you could play against the computer cuz sometimes it takes ppl a long time to play back if even.
Just stinks that you have to wait for coins or buy them, otherwise fun and addictive enough to remain installed on my phone:)
I really enjoy playing this game
So fun and addicting. I gave it four stars because you never seem to have enough coins!
I love this game but you keep charging more tokens! Now you've cut the amount of tokens!!! Not liking that at all!
The only problem I have is it freezes sometimes!
Addictive!
The game is fun! The only problem is the constant force closing. Very annoying. If they fix that problem I would give it 5 stars.
I love this game; so addicting. I wish there was an option to play vs computer..it would allow for  more practice games.
Awesome game. Thanks for finally adding the "nudge" button.
I would have rated it 5 stars but I hate waiting for tokens. With all the ads, the users shouldn't gave to wait to play.
I love this game, its so awesome I njoy playing.
So addicting, I play a few times a day...
Good learning game.
Great game addicting
Takes too long for more tokens!!!
Great way to pass up time.
Great for young kids and adults.
Very fun
It's a lot of fun. Like boogle. I had to turn off notifications because it was making my phone lag. Wish it didn't take so long to get more tokens. Obviously they want to make $. Who doesn't? Good app!
Love the game, but locks and freezes phone whenever played.
Liking so far just wish you got more coins faster
Love it just learning how to play
Great addictive game, but has some glitches. Constantly says need wifi to run, and won't load, but when it does, is a lot of fun.
Freezes too often. Don't like the tokens. Get advertisers to sponsor.
Love it!
Pretty good. Can lag some.
Great game.  Freezes phone ALOT though. Droid X2.
Lots of fun.
Overall great game...i may not win very many games but still enjoy the competition.  What i would like to see is a stats feature.  Something to show win/lose, highest total score, highest word score or something to that extent.  Once these are available....I'll give it a 5 star rating.
A lot od fun, but freezes a lot
This app loads slowly and is sometimes buggy but it's still super fun.
Love it
Overall this app is basically very functionable but could improve a few features. First off, in the last 10 seconds of the game, your power ups bounce making them much harder to press, defeating the purpose of them moving to remind you they exist, lame. Secondly if you are about to end a round, place your finger on a letter and leave it there past the time limit, you will be allowed to make one last word off the letter you pressed.

The game freezes often on the galaxy s2 unfortunately as i love the game. As others hav said u hav 2 go into task manager 2 exit the app as it hogs the cpu and makes fone hot. sometimes by doin this you will suddenly hav less time when resuming the game
Lots of fun and addicting,but you run out of free tokens fairly quickly.   M T
Cut coin replenish time for five stars!
Love the game, but uninstalled it after it started loading video ads, with sound, and a mandatory period where they can't be skipped. Completely unacceptable.
nice
Game is cool but it makes my Electrify crash to much and what's up with the coins?
best game to challenge your mind
Really fun with good service. Sometimes it crashes when playing too fast but very enjoyable.

Fuking luv this game
Super fun way to pass time on my commute to work.
Love this game! Wish you could have unlimited coins, but I get it. Money.
Love the game, but hate the limited plays due to coins
Love this game I play it everyday just wish it wouldn't take so long to get our free coins. Otherwise this game is lots if fun!	I love this game!!! Just wish we didn't have to be limited on how many games we can play! Otherwise I love it lots of fun!
Great game but it freeze too many times. Find myself rebooting game a lot.
Fun, addictive, but short. Have 2 get alot of games goin @ 1 time 2 really njoy
Fun and addictive game. Good time waster. No problems on my HTC Desire.
Love playing it. Addictive to the point of cannot stop playing. Cant you reduce 20mins to 10mins so we get more game play. I can see why you dont as those who cannot wait buy coins to continue playing.
Very fun. I love playing. It does freeze up sometimes and I have to restart game and/or phone
Fab game just annoyed bit the unavailability of a delete option for old games..Grrrr
This one of the best word games around, if you enjoy Scrabble then this is a must have app.
Fun, runs nicely on my android,  get power ups. Only downside I can find is: If opponents don't play their turn there is no way to resign,am and you can only have so many open games.
great game. freezes/slows sometimes. not entirely sure if that's the game or my phone.
Can i play on my own??? Beat my best score? Tht would be great
Difficult to find friends by username
Enjoy playing the game but dread waiting on the coins to build up
Luv it
I like the game but the coins are the only set back.
Really fun to play! only problem is that sometimes it crashes...but not often...
Thanks for another great game! My only suggestion to make it so regular coins were used and paid for coins were bonus when those were gone............ I would buy coins more often if the daily coins were used and then paid for coins were used.
I can't stop playing this game.
I'm not too good at it though I could use a little more time :-)
Fun
This is a good game to challenge you with word identification asking with the time pressure. It performs reliably with my Samsung Galaxy. However, in order to keep playing you have to buy more tokens our play very slowly.
Love this game. Worth the download!
Love the game but coins get over too fast.....
Sucks that u have to wait or pay for tickets if I run out
Few glitches from time to time but all in all solid app.  Better than wordswithfriends.
Should give new letters but whatever. Still fun.
Great app! But you have to buy coins, no bueno.
Great ap but wish that there were no limits on how many active games you can have when you still have mass coins. Also when someone doesn't finish their game with you they air on your list taking up space and you have no way of resigning the game. Lame!
Has alot of freezing that leads to other problems so annoying I uninstalled. But I do love the game its awesome. Needs improvement though
Love the game except for having to wait on more coins..
Fun game!  I'm new so not real sure how to play but I'm learning.
Awesome... Addictive.
Fun to play, but slows down my HTC at times.
fun game
Great game . Only wish there was a way to get out of games when people are not playing instead of resigning .
It's addictive...
I really like this game
Way better  Thin words wit friends but cn get borin afta uh while
Love this game!!!!!
Wud have awarded 5 stars if not for the token limitations. Wud be better if they were only required for power-ups not play, & one really should earn tokens for winning. I mean, it's very frustrating to have to wait so long for token regeneration & the cost of token purchases are far too expensive imo. Otherwise, the game is fantastic! Well done.
A lot of fun ! (:
Like playing this game, just like boggle from when I was a kid
Great game, keeps you sharp.
Hate how much wait time there is for your coins to fill up, but it is free
Lots of fun...wish it would be able to play more without having to wait for coins
Must have app to play against mates or friends
Fun but shuts down too much.
Coins should only b needed for power ups! Other than that its cool
Fun Game!!!
Fun but can only play 3xs. You will have to buy coins to play more.
Simple fun. Too long delays and pop ups. Money money money.
Game runs slow on my Droid Charge, but I think that's the device, not the app.  The powerups add a bit of strategy to the game.  Casual word-gamers will enjoy this.
Fun game, play almost everyday.
Very cool game
This game is addicting!
It's another great socially addictive game!
Totally awesome  and highly addictive! Hangs up sometimes though.
There should be a way to earn tokens rather then having to buy them.
Lots of fun. Challenging. Haven't gotten bored with it yet. Similar in some ways but different than Words with Friends.
Way too many ads. Annoying.
Great game to play when you have a few minutes.
Fun game that you can play against others and enrich your brain!
Great competitive game.  Only drawback is that my game stops a lot and i have to reset.
I love it alot
Love it
You learn new words Ever time
Great game much like the classic Boggel. Would be 5 stars but want to be able to delete off past games or for those opponents who dont play of take ages to play.
I really like this game, tho i am discovering if i dont get faster i may not like it much longer. That is definitely my problem and not yours. Great game.
It's a fun game but wish it didn't freeze and we won coins for winning!
I was playing woth my friend,the pop up notif to indicate my turn was a bit lag in time..shud work on that
It wud b nice to b able to delete inactive players before the current time limit automatically does so.  Also, it wud be good to be able to resign from a game on their turn if needed.
I can't stop playing, well until I run out of tokens! Lol! Very addictive!
I enjoy word games and this one is so much fun. The timing makes it a challenge and also keeps it from being a huge time waster. Wish there were a few more tokens or less time to regenerate them. All in all I'll keep playing.
Very fun!
Freezes often
Weird scoring but fun
Great game love it
Just wish it didn't run out of coins so fast.
Love it but should get coins for winning, I refuse to ever buy coins
The coins run out fast but the game is fun.
Waiting time is long though.
Very addictive game but more than once, the game I'm playing suddenly stops three quarters into the game and restarts around the minute mark when I resume the game. I lose my train of thought and I don't know which words it didn't save and have to redo again. Please fix. But it's still an awesome game.
Good game, sometimes freezes halfway through but enjoy it
It will be better to give a coin in less time than almost 30 min...
Fun
Like the game and can be challenging to play.  I have 2 items I would like to share. The first is the feeling of being treated unfairly.  I have payed for more coins after realizing a person can rack up the games.  However, I don't get the token allotment each day, or whatever time limit is set. that go to everyone else who just so happens to be not paying to play.  It seems unfair. I should be getting my free tokens along with  everyone else. I certainly play enough to use up both kind of tokens.
Pretty fun, can be challenging and time goes by quick when playing it. Wish the extra coins were cheaper or more coins for the money but a pretty fun game.
Freezes from yime to time but great app
Its great
Like it better then words with friends
I like it alot
Love this game but the sound keep going out in the middle of the game. Only easy the fix it is to go the apps, settings amd do a forced close on the AP before start the next rounds.
I gave the game only 4 stars instead if 5 because I think the cost of coins are too high. I really do enjoy the game
Funtimes
This game is so fun. It just freezes sometimes. It also runs in the background a lot. I always have to stop it so it doesn't eat up my memory. Other than that I love it.
Very good game. Sometimes slow.
It's addictive and a lot of fun.
Really fun but like I'd like an app like this with one player only cos I don't want to waste all my internet usage
I have the droid x2 and have had a hard time loading sometimes, other times plays great.  My phone will freeze up, and I will to pull the battery out and restart....fix plz!
Very fun game, need to mix letters better and reward coins quicker
Seriously this is a must play everyday! Love everything about it! Brilliant!
Love the game.  Lots of fun and helps eveyone work their brain.  But i don't understand the point of the coins.  Let us just play for goodness sakes.
I enjoy this game and being able to chat while playing is fun too!
Very addicting. Wish we didn't have to wait for coins though.
Game works fine but ad pop ups suck however they are clean ads
Other than freezing its a great game.
It's fun, wish I could earn free coin faster...
Was a great game. Now includes video ads which play between rounds and which attempt to force you to watch them. They actually have the gall to try to PREVENT you from exiting the program until you've let the ad play fully.  Avoid at all costs until this is corrected
This is really fun. Can't stop playing it.
Fun game to play with friends!
Its a fun game but it freezes up at time
Its a cool game
Screw the coin system being a problem, I don't play that much and don't feel the need to waste my money on them. Just be patient! They have several other, fun "With Friends" games to choose from while you wait on coin regeneration. The "smart match," on the other hand, isn't matching me with people with my skill-level. So, if anyone averages 60 words per game, play samilovesscats. I need a challenge!!
I really love this game! It's my favorite game!!!!!!!
Really fun
Great game
Very smooth and well made app. I've been playing with friends and strangers daily for a few months.
Love this game
I love playing this game, but it does not work on my LG Ally! It won't even load and makes all my other apps not work either! Would give it 0 stars if I could! Deleted!
Love this game
Great!
So much fun!
I love this game
Excellent game but hangs sometimes with my HTC Desire c .... Please fix

Fun to play
Fun, addicting game!
Best game on android market.
Stresses me out a little cuz its timed, but its fun.
Love this game
This is a great game that will satisfy the competitive nerd in all of us!
Love this game. Very well designed and created. Runs smoothly. Super fun!
Love this game could literally play for hours no problems at all
Love this game. Just wish you didn't have to use coins.
Love this app! The game is fun and the adds are unobtrusive!
Great!
Love this game!! Just wish you would give more tokens instead of having to wait for them or buying them.
great fun!
Best game EVER!!!
I'd like to give it one star...takes up to much time during the day...and night! Great game!
This game is so much fun! One of the best word games in a while.
If after 3 days an opponent doesn't play? The game is dropped. Face it...they are not coming back. Change this please!
I like playing particularly with my kids.  This game has reignited their desires to learn words.
Very fun
It's a okay game pretty tight
Quality game!!
Awesome and Fun!!! <3
Love it
Cool game
Love this game..great past time with fam n friends
Playing with all my family and fb friends. Fun game
I jist wish you didn't have to play it with people
So addictive
Fun and interactive.
Good  game
Passes the time
Very addictive.
If you like this type of word game, this is a great way to play.
I love this application. My girlfriend stumbled across this one afternoon after growing impatient on hanging with friends and hasnt turned back sense. It is digital crack. The best part is that you can look at the combination of words that you didnt find which, for me, makes me look at each puzzle more vividly. FANTASTIC APP.

As others have said, this game is so good it becomes addictive.  I wish though, there was a quicker way of getting tokens.Also being able to resign if you've been waiting for someone to reply for some time, would be great too.
Play all the time.
All STARS game!

I love this game. It's great to play either with family, or with friends. It doesn't take up alot of your time at once, but allows you to play when you have a few minutes. :)
Very fun
Favorite game on my cell!!
Great game! Wish I got more coins cause its addictive! :)
I love this game its really addicting and fun
Yes:......
Fun game
I enjoy being victorious, and having competition, and losing, but there just needs to be something you work towards. Like an incentive to winning. Idk what you could possibly come up with, but I'd appreciate something small like maybe a coin or a mention on facebook. Just something that says I just won. Maybe a blank key. Otherwise, great game.
Awesome
Loved it
Super fun game good for the brains.
Fun, fun, fun
It's a great but the free tokens come to slow. The first week I forked over about 50$ because I wanted to complete games. I am disabled vet and I can't afford it all the time now I cannot finish games tokens come to.slow
Fun
Galaxy s3 n it runs great love this game!

This game is awesome !!! Uses a lot of thought process !!! Very funnnn game :)
Awesome
Really fun easy way to play with friends. Or you can just start up a game with a random person. It's basically boggle with a different points system. There is a limit for how many games you can play in a row, but its really not a problem
Love this game. Nothing bad to say. Just the hole coin thing kills it. If anything it should cost one coin for everything. So you don't run out so fast.
Love this game!!!! Addicted!!!
Love it
Love this game! It keeps the ole brain thinking and is just a short burst of fun!

I'm addicted & have been for awhile now... Even paid for the add-free version that gives back a token after 10 min. instead of 20. Allows you to play a lot more games in less time.

Need a better way to get more tokens that's the only problem look like if you win you would be rewarded instead of waiting all that time also need more specials to choose from

Nice

Love it!!! So fun!!! The computer generated players cheat tho.. They score like 800 per round lmao but it is a way to practice.
Awesome game constantly playing with mates
Goooooooood game. Brain teaser  that forces one to use ones mind. Four stars only because five represents perfection and no one or nothing is perfect.
Love the app but IM am really getting upset when the person never returns to finish the game and you have reached your limit and can not add another game.
I enjoy playing this game. Great app

Da bomb
Good game
Great game
After playing this game for a while... It seems there is a bot playing because there is no way someone can get 700 points or about 60 words from this game. Impossible. The game is good but I want to see if you can fix this flaw.
Love this game... Been waiting a long time for someone to make it... Thanks
Great way to play with friends anywhere in the world, kill time and keep the brain sharp

Once you get good at this game, its a buzz. Great fun vs friends. Using HTC One
Love it!!!
Game.sure keeps u on ur feet...I meant hands! I love playing. Some days are.good; others aren't. I play to keep from losing my cognitive skills cuz I have progressive multiple sclerosis.and my body's breaking down faster than I thought. Oh well this too shall pass
Works away awesomely on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus II! Great challenge for the brain. I'm always trying to improve my time.
Love it!  Very addicting!!
Best time killer
This game is very addictive once you usr to it. I hate that it requires tokens to power up.
Easy to learn and compelling. Really like this game
It ruins the whole gameplay to,the point  where I,can't play anymore. Was,five star before update
Honestly I am surprised by how much I enjoy this game! It seems so easy but appearances are deceptive it really challenges you to use your eyes and to really SEE words in a whole different way. Absolutely love and would  recommend for anyone seeking a challenge.
This game is fun and addicting and u will only be mad wen u have to wait for more free coins hahaha lol
Love this game!
Epic!!!!'
Keeps the mind sharp
Great game very addicting.
Love competitive games!
It's a really great game I can play all day the only thing just need more tokens
I absolutely love this game!
Fun fast paced  game. More fun then words w friends. Wish more people would play it takes days before people respond back when it is their turn. And they need to supply more tokens to play.
Excellent!
Really enjoy playin this game althou could av a bit longer time works really well on samsung s3
I love this game!

It bring me sooooo much fun. But I always loose.
Fun game!
It definitely makes you think..thats for sure..
excellent game i enjoy playing scramble with friends keep me updated witg other word games
Wish they had practice sets for you to improve on your games without playing with an opponent.
I just wished coins accrued faster... I'd play all day then!
The coin limit for the free game I get, but even if you buy the game you're still limited!..Complete and total runbish! The popularity of this game is unfortunate since it only encourages this horrendous manipulation of people looking for a bit of fun...In a word, BOOOOO!
Addictive at work
Cant get enough of the game.  Hate waiting for enough tokens to play.
Cant get enough of the game.  Hate waiting for enough tokens to play.
I never get bored with it and always love playing when I get a little extra time in my day! It's very addicting! I have no complaints about it at all! Very good game!
love it
Super fun and runs great on a galaxy nexus.
It is an excellent game
Addicting!
Fast, leisurely play, power up with tokens, but nothing out there to help your opponents
Luv it!!!
Awesome pass time and let's you know how much you suck at words
Love it!!!!!
I love this game!! :)
I Love This Game!!
Scrabble with Friends is fun & great while waiting for someone else to take their turn you can have the game choose an opponent & continue to play.
I like it. An app that makes you smarter...lol what a pun! Wish there wasn't so many ads that randomly interrupt you while playing, also would be nice if it stopped freezing all the time, plus sometimes the bonus tips you pay coins for don't work which really irritates me! :( would be awesome if the winner of a game actually won something, like coins? As incentive to continue playing, maybe have contests with other players as to who has the most coins? Please fix the bugs this app is my fav!!

Love it.!!! cant freaking stop playing it :]
Really enjoy playing. Very intense at times. Best part is that it doesn't require you to make actual purchases like most other games in order to get coins. Just wait and after some time it refills ur coins. Pretty cool game.
Very addicting

Really enjoy this fast paced game.  By far, this is a favorite of mine.
Luvin it
Good challenging game...keeps your mind active and the eye hand coordination is a good way to spend game time, vocabulary and spelling are challenged...only draw back is the tokens..they go fast.
Love this game!
Super fun, and highly addictive. Hard to get the hang of, but once you've got it you wont want to stop!
Great game!
Great free game ! Of course I want more coins faster...Runs smooth for my HTC Vivid. I do agree with others, you should be able to cancel games against non-responsive players. I do like the idea of winning a few coins, if you win the game !
Great Game!!!!!!
So addicted to this game..love it!
Love all Zynga games!

Occupies me quite a bit.
Excellent time killer when Angry Birds isn't enough.

This is app is really great I mean a lot of people complain about how there's not enough tokens but unless u have a lot of games going on u will be fine cuz u can have a max of 20 tokens for free I think and u get another one after 20 minutes so I'm usually fine but I think it would be nice to get more tokens If u won.
Good time waster

I used to love this game, but for the past month it hasn't worked. I can't get it to load at all. I have tried to uninstall then reinstall and it still isn't working. I can't get past the login.  (The game has finally been restored and working great again. Thank you!)

Endless fun or until you run out of tokens. Haha!

10 for Excellent
Love is game
A very good time killer and a good way to learn words on days that don't have any potential for doing anything else.  More fitted to a phone with a larger screen although. Works very nicely on Galaxy Nexus (4.65 inch screen)
I try this and see that its pretty good game. Just want to see the coin stock to get upgraded. ;-)
Awesome
Don't like you have to wait 20 mins for one coin
Love this game!
So much fun...it would be nice though if you hit play again by accident and the other player doesn't want to you could get rid of the game.
Very Fun game! Happy its finally available on the Android Market
This game is awesome, dangerously addicting too! Only complaint is that it needs more variety of words.... So much fun though!!

Great game good for the mind and fun!!!
Fun
Best form of brain exercise.
I love the game and have no complaints other than I probably spend too much time playing when I should be doing something else! No tech problems and the ads are resonable-unlike many other free games.
just wish I was faster!
Very fun game! Play it daily.
Really enjoy playing this game. Wished there was  a multiplayer option
I wouldn't change a thing!
The app works well. I get to play my friends, and this game never bores me.
Awsome I love this game
Hate when it freezes
Fun and exciting but should provide more tokens =[
Love this game but it can take several days to complete. Once you make a move, the person you play against may take several days to make their move so I get fed up and resign the game
FUN AND ADDICTING!!!
Awesome game!!! Totally addicting!
love this app !!!
It's an awesome time killer really fun to play
Love it
It's great! Plays well, no lags. Except, lately it's notifying me that I have a message when I don't. Either I did have a message and it cannot be seen OR I didn't have a message and it's a glitch
This is a really fun game
This is a really fun game
Love this game!
Great game!
Sometimes there's a time lag, but hey, finish your cooking or cleaning chores or complete your errands. You could even read a short book to your child or make an important call and say "I love you mom. I love you dad."  Have fun! Life is short!
Awesome sauce
Great game
Love love love this game. Wish it had a practice mode so I can get faster without playing with someone.
Fun game, brain power!
Fun game, brain power!
Keeps you on your feet and the different levels of help is cool. I rather play this than words with friends.
I even get frustrated with my friends if the don't play fast enough!
Fun times with friends.
Love it!@
Very awesome game i hope every one plays it ! I have a lot of fun playing this game every one should play this game <3 you see its fun! :)
This game is super fun and super great to play with family and friends! It works perfect. I have had no problems with it whatsoever. There is one thing that would be cool to have, it is the "Pass and Play." It is such a nice feature to have on Words With Friends and think it would be great to have the same feature on Scramble With Friends. Overall, the game rocks!
Just wish you didn't have to wait so long for more coins.
Love the game! Hate waiting 20 minutes for a new coin, not accumulating a coin for winning, and having to buy coins. By the time I catch up on all my turns I'm out of coins for hours!
Awesome!
Awesome!
Fun FUN FuN fUn
great game.
great game.
I love love love this game !!!

Love this game! Super addictive
At first I was the only addict, but soon enough almost as if it was infectious, my whole circle of family and friends became "scramblers" aswell. Amazing game. Keep innovating, keep entertaining :)
Fun game!
I love this game. I think they should give you more coins to play with & if people don't accept your game after a certain amount of time their game should be cancelled.
Very fun to play
This  game is awesome come play me: )
Good game
Ooh man this game is great!
Fun game really like it

Great game for entertainment!!!!
This is an awesome and fun game. I wish they would start you off with 20 coins instead of 14. Other than that if you love word games this is your game.

I love this game! Never had any problems with it!

Good app. Lots of fun.

Another great at you're own pace game to play with friends.
Very addicting. You have to try it.
Cool little game... Neat way 2 pass the time... U should be able 2 choose your own length of time @ the beginning of each game...
Very addictive
Great free game, implemented well.  Highly recommended. Runs perfectly on my Asus tablet.  A practice mode would be a nice addition - maybe 3 practices for 1 coin?
Really enjoying this game!
Love playing with friends and with strangers
Great fun and addictive game!
;)
I really like this game alot! If they came up with a way to earn coins instead of having to buy them that would be cool! I was thinking if you win the person, that you get a certain amount of coins. Kinda like draw something or hanging with friends!
Love this game.. Works great on Samsung galaxy S2.
simple, short, fun

Addicting game even while losing most the gamesI've played.

I always loved boggle and loved playing it on my touch laptop...but now I got on my phone..anytime...the only thing that sucks is that its on coins and if u run out u can't play , u either have to wait or buy some.
I find I can't seem to put it down. I play it for hours and hours.

Too bloated for me. Typical zynga focusing more on unnecessary flashy graphics than functionality.
Need more players!!
Very addicting, love playing this game with my friends
Fun and challenging game!
Addicting.!!
This game is addictive.  I enjoy playing with people I don't know & retaining anonymity.  Also, the fast pace makes the game thrilling and fun.  I'd love a challenge round forcing players to step their game up & winners should get some bonus coins!
Great game
I love playing this game its fun and exciting!

Great app.  Play on my Android and kindle fire.  Works well on both devices.  Ads are easy to get past quickly.  Only problem I've encountered is that I can't quit playing.
Love it
Gettin better
Only wish I could see a list of words I've played during the timed game, not just afterwards.
The only problem I have with this game is waiting 20mins for one token :-(
Love it
Great game!!
Fun as hell
Great game
It is super fun if you are a word person.
the game is great but I wish when you run out of tokens you can get free tokens by downloading apps or you could just shorten the time on the timer for another token im saying this because I love playing this game and I run out of tokens fast.

With only 3 rounds you must be super quick. Though Playing at your own pace for this kind of game is not really my idea of fun, totally worth downloading
Great game but too many of same letters in every puzzle
Love it
Love this game just wish  you didjt have to wait for new coins and more words were accepted
I so enjoy this game... With Family and Friends.

I LOVE this game but... It is frustrating that u don't get coins when u win, I keep having to buy them and when u purchase them they do not automatically reproduce. WTH? It is super fun and I am addicted but u need to change the coin issue. I never have to spend $ on Words w Friends, shouldn't have to on this game either. NEED to change!!!!!!! PLEASE!!!! Otherwise I would give 5 stars.

This game is pretty fun but y do I we have to purchase more tokens when we run out of dem y cent we gte tokens by winning, also how can I delete the people on there that I dent wanna with no more
Love this game!!"
Awesome!
Fast and fun game to play. Would give 5 star if players are allowed to cancel games that are waiting too long.
good game
Love this game!
It's ok
I really enjoy playing this game! I wish they would allow you to cancel games you start with friends that don't play you back or lift the limits on games you can start. My game is full of rounds waiting for people to play their turn and I can't start any new games. We should be able to cancel rounds that have been sitting there for days. No fun when I can only play a couple rounds a day.  Also I wish they had a practice mode so you could just play for fun while waiting on friends to play their turn.
Love word games imma spelling champ lol

I installed this on my samsung repp, and right away when I launched it encountered problems loading the game. Played 2 rounds with friends and everything stalled, restart phone. Went through this twice, removed battery and am now scared to try launching the game again as my other apps are finally working properly again. Love the game itself, just scared to play it on my phone now :-(
I have had no problems w/ this app. Love Scramble! Awesome game!

I hate this game because I cannot stop playing it. Easy to learn. Easy to play.

Love this.  However, Freezes/slows on occasion
If you love words, you'll love this game. The satisfying gameplay will keep you interested and engaged. The power ups are GREAT when you need that second wind or inspiration . The sounds and graphics are rewarding without being invasive or distracting. More than likely, the only complaint is about the coin system. It prevents one from playing as often as they please. It's a little odd. Great game. Highly reccomended.
Entertainment for hours
Fast pace and works the mind!
I like it cause its a quick game doesn't take much time. It keeps ya thinking!
Great game!
Loving it. Can't stop playing!
Sweet game to play against friends
Everything's great. My suggestion, I hope words don't highlight at all when we touch on them
The most addictive word game I have played. Only please come up with a pass to player game mode.  If you do that then I rate it 5.
Cool game
Love the game and how fast it ends:)
This game is really fun to play, me and my wife love this game
Great game, great diversity.
The best and most addictive game!
Great fun game. I wish I could continue to play but i run out of coins. I refuse to purchase more coins. I just have to wait for it to reset.
love this game. More coins please.
Love love love it

Great game
LUV THIS GAME & GOT MY FRIENDS IN2 2 :)
Just as good as the home version, without the drunk relative who screams out the words.
I like the game only thing I don't like is you should be able to use the same power up all 3 times if you choose to like before update
Lllloooovveee it
AWESOME
Play it everyday!!!!!
Play it everyday!!!!!
Addicting and fun game!
I love this game. It is so addicting!! You want to keep playing to get those words!!!! Fun, frustrating, addictive !
At first I thought it would be weird and boring but its super fun
Great tune up for playing scrabble
Best app to kill time.  Kind of glitchy on the galaxy x.  Doesnt have as quick of reaction time.
Addicting! But my game keeps freezing sometimes! Still lots of fun though! :)
I like it

Very fun no problems
Great game...

Fully addicting, but great way to rack your brain...keeps me on my toes.
It's fun and it exercises your brain at the same time
It's about time for some already. You can hook more people this way. Average score, high score, high round score, total wins vs losses against certain opponents... Etc.
LOVE IT!! Android
Awesome
I absolutely love this game! me and my fiancée play almost everyday while we are on break from work
Fun game!
Love it, just wish people could keep up with me lol how about a solo-play version?
I want to play it more n more! It makes me mad that my 19 yr old daughter keeps beating the pants off me!

Love it play it all day
Fantastic fun! Easy to learn and certainly makes you think quick
fun game!
I love this game wish it had other ways to learn more tokens
It's great!
This is a great game, I really enjoy playing we ith family, friends and masking new friends.
Very addictive. The only bad thing is when your opponents don't finished the round and  don't end the game, their is no cancel option.
Good fun. Never can beat anyone though.

Too many "forced close" issues, often does not register selection, slow to load. I love the concept and was a favorite, but recent upgrades are a step in the wrong direction IMO.

This game is wicked! Would highly recommend it! Must have app 5* :)
Why is it If you win you DONT get coins? Why does it cost a coin just to start a game? In order to acquire more coins, you have to BUY them or wait 20min. Thats shady :( can we win them please?
Fabulous, fun & addicting. Highly recommended!
Fab!!!

Wow!!! Vry gud game...
Up until a few days ago, this app worked fine... Now, I can't even open it without it force closing.  Even after force closing it, the program continues to run (I guess) because I have to continue force closing it.  This has been reported a few times, but the issue is still present.
The only issue I have is if people don't play after a couple days we should be able to resign
Addictive as hell, and helps stimulate the mind. Remembering words I haven't used since school days.
Love this game!!!!!
Yup
The game is great, but it does freeze sometimes in the middle of your turn and you do lose your progress.
Absolutely lovee this game!!!!!!
The best!!! Nexus

It's a fun quick game you can do with friends and mock eachother later for missing words or the words they come up with. If you prefer, play with a stranger, they usually do a good job pairing you up
Love this game! Just watch for the freeze power up, sometimes it doesn't give you all the time, but great little game!

Very nice but you will loose your time just like that. Dont get too addicted
I wish my wang  was bigger
Fun!
This is my new favorite game. I just wish I didn't run out of tokens so quickly and that it didn't cost 1 token just to play. It should only cost a token if u choose to use your cheats. Play should be for free. Help should not be. And you should get tokens for each game you have going. Not 20 coins total to play all you're games. I run out of tokens after 2-3 games. Love the game but hate the tokens.
Brilliant game, so fast paced, I can't think fast enough!!
Addictive game to improve your brain power.
It's a lot of fun
I love this game. I do wish u could earn tokens for winning it something. Other than that it us super fun. My husband and I can't stop.

I am hopelessly addicted to this game, very well done,  it's a great mental workout and I love playing my friends, deserves 10 stars.
This game is so fun and addicting. I only wish it didn't limit the number if games you can start. It is probably good though because otherwise I would play all day.

Very addictive.
Love it. It get my brains working.
Fun way to play with family & friends.
Good game but stupid token idea
Enjoyable game
It is a wonderful, fun, and educational game!  I play everyday,  sometimes 3 or 4 a day!  It helps me to think outside the box.  It helps strengthen my brain cells and my memory.  I am thankful for this game and for the person who shared it with me.  I have shared it with many other people.  They all love it!
This is one of my favorite games just wish they gave more tokens in 20 mins. But I love this game!!
Good fun game without overly annoying advertisements like a lot of other games.
Awesome. Super addictive and challenging.
You can play against your friends or random people. Works perfectly and is fun. Must download game app.
Love this game. Very addictive though. Bite size chunks of games - 2mins per round. Love it.
I love it

It's a lot of fun but it needs to have a one-player version!

Easy to play. Fast games. Lots of fun.
Love the game. Don't like waiting for an opponent. It would be nice if you could play against the computer while waiting.
When you start playing there are not very many words to see in the square. All of the blocks of words have 300 or 400 words. You just have to learn to see them. Everyday you can see more and you just laugh at yourself
Love it!!!
Way better than Words with Friends!!!!
I love this game, I'm just not about to spend real money to get more coIns.What will they come up with next?
I like it cuz it teaches u new  words

I hsv lots of fun playing n gets to push myself. The prob wif this game is u hav to wait a very long time for a coin. How abt a coin for every game u win?
Love this game! I play it every day. I wish there was a way to earn coins since the new options use up the coins. Also, more time on the clock!!
Great app, addictive and challenging, without the guilt!
Great game....

Great application for passing time while exercising the brain. Token reloads should be bit more frequent for consistent game play. I give Scramble With Friends a 4.5/5

One of the only games where my wife and myself are not better or worse than each other.
Awesome game,u guys should try it
I thoroughly enjoy playing
My daughter and I love this game. It is really helping her with spelling...
Great game! i love it....But I also think that we should get a free coin for every game we win..and wait less time for a new coin cuz 20 mins can be a long wait..
Of all the games i have ever downloaded this is one game i never get tired of. It's fun and it makes me want to beat my last word score everytime!
good! a little slow for droids.
Love this game. Still learning, but I can't put it down. Created multiple games just to keep playing!
It's a fun game to play with friends
Fun but lots of levels repeat... See lots of same words... Winner of each round should get a coin! Coin system limits play.
Totally fun game!...I play it all the time...been meeting all kinds of good competitors just like myself:)
Best word game ever.!
Zynga, if I rate scramble 5 stars, you need to feed my addiction with more coins!  Tons of fun limited by coins. Didn't like the coin concept at first but It's the only way to keep me from losing my job and family. My addiction Is strong for this fabulous game!

It is addictive....<3
I love the game but it freezes a lot while the clock keeps ticking
Just freezes up on me sometimes u should get rid of the "time freeze" power up if ure gonna have the "vision" power up, and add a new power up to replace the time freeze..just cause it is basically the same power up, but great game overall
The best game ever!
Nice & entertaining.

I love scrammble...its a great way of playing and communicating with friends...it also helps to improve literature skills in the aspects of spelling & vocabulary!!!:):)
Very fun game, it test you wits,speed and vocabulary, only dis like is that you have to use coins to play and at times it takes so long for coins unless you buy them.

I really enjoy this game its lots of fun I been hooked since the first time I played but I do have some complaints I hate waiting 20 mins for more coins why must we wait 20 mins 2 get only 1 coin? Why don't the winners get rewarded coins 4 high scores? Why not reward the players with coins 4 spelling big words? I hate it when I wait 20 mins 4 a coin 2 play and my screen freezes up r even worse than that my phone totally shuts itself off!! I luv the game but hate the flaws!!
Love it just learning how to play
Great addictive game, but has some glitches. Constantly says need wifi to run, and won't load, but when it does, is a lot of fun.
It's easy to understand & play, and a good way to pass the time when you have 2 minutes to kill
Love it...
Entertaining and fun. Makes you think and be creative. I enjoy playing.
I love playing this game u can play with your friends and if u don't have anyone they'll pick a random person
Great game for grown ups who can think and link quick :)
Excellent game.  Worth the download.

I truly love this game and hope more people catch-on and start to play.  Zynga, stop oimiting the number of games a player can start.
Thought this game would be hard to figure out when trying to play with your friends. It is super easy though fun addicting. Must have game for the phone. Thanks

There should be a way to earn coins or something! Or like another suggested only pay for power ups
The title says it all.

Love playing it. Addictive to the point of cannot stop playing. Cant you reduce 20mins to 10mins so we get more game play. I can see why you dont as those who cannot wait buy coins to continue playing.
Fun game.

Great word game
Brilliant game, just hard sometimes haha. PS those with low end phones should stop complaining (Samsung Ace)
Love this game & fact you can play either friends, family or strangers. Works fine on my Sony Arc
How about it being FREE to play and extra coins ONLY when u use the extra power ups? Why coins just to play, anyway?
Im hooked
Awesome and addictive!!!!
My favorite addiction
Play it multible times a day for months now!  "Unbeatible"
Such a fun game!
Nobody wants to play with me cause I am so flipping good!
I love this game!

Makes a nice distraction anytime.
Makes a nice distraction anytime.
Great game, super fun but a huge time suck. My fault I guess. I'm addicted for sure.
I love it and don't know why I didn't try it before. A puzzle with a time limit. Down side is the tokens. Why have a limit on playing? Maybe make it per match? Also an awesome game.
Great Game!!!
Love
Thanks for another great game! My only suggestion to make it so regular coins were used and paid for coins were bonus when those were gone............ I would buy coins more often if the daily coins were used and then paid for coins were used.
Very fun and challenging. Fun for "Wordies"
This game is great and addicting.    La Shaun
So much fun.

Great fun & quick to play
Must have app to play against mates or friends
Awesome game love it love itt
Very little bugs & has nice variety through the periodic updates which offer different powerups. A little more variety would be nice but overall a must have for users that like to play each other.
Sometimes it jams and I have to restart and sometimes my Swyping doesn't work great, but overall I enjoy it a lot.
Absolutely addictive!!!!
FunGame, addicted to it!
Game runs slow on my Droid Charge, but I think that's the device, not the app.  The powerups add a bit of strategy to the game.  Casual word-gamers will enjoy this.
Fantastic fun taking only a few mins each time - very addictive
Favorite word game!
yep UN huh
Very fun with friends .
Love it!  Wish you could have options for a longer time like 2, 3, or 5 minutes to play.
I love this game, only complaint is the game takes my tokens for the power ups even if I don't use them!
I love this game, I always play with friends and family and random opponents! I love all the Zynga games!
A great game, great set up, could use a little improvement, but nothing comes to mind. Overall a very addictive game

addictive and fun to play with friends and family
This game is addicting!
I just wish I could have more games going then what is allowed.
It's a lot of fun! I look forward to my notifications when one of my 'friends' has played their turn and I can play again.
Just wish you weren't limited to only 10 open games.
Brilliant,good time passer and mind exercise
Quick and fun.
It's fun and makes me use my brain!! I like the use of tokens bc for me it limits how long I play. Lol Every now and then I get an error but that's expected. But great app overall!
Best ever
Enjoy playing the game. Really makes you think
easu way  to play with friends
A blast
Love the game!!!
Love the game!!!
I like that I can't see my opponents score until after the round is over. It makes me want to try and score high.
Fun
Slow at times, but loads of fun! Will add all my friends.
Great game to play when you have a few minutes.

If you already like words games, you'll love this game.  Rounds are quick, you can play @ your level.  I have no complaints.  I play w/ hubby everyday.  Ads are minimal :)
Great
Great
I love this game! Works great on my nexus 7. To those that complain about having to pay for coins or wait for coins...do you think the game developers spend all their time creating a game, troubleshooting a game and making sure it's compatible with all devices, etc...and they should just let it be completely free? Don't you think they have bills to pay too? If you can't afford to buy the coins (like me)...at least you can still play.
Looooooove this game!
Looooooove this game!
Love the game!
Wish you had the option to play by yourself. Plus there is too much time in between coins. Other than that its great.
+you learn some new glarb was a new one for me. Works good freezes now and then
amazing game... i love it... just give 2 coins together instead of one every 20 minns
best
