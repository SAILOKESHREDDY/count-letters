Excellent app works on Samsung nexes s i9020
Good but setup of main screen could be better but other than than that pretty good
Sucks
Won't. Scan
Hard to scan some qr codes.
Great
The QrScanner free app worked so much better than this one. This one didn't read anything from the get go
I uninstalled this and went for QR BARCODE SCANNER cos this one wouldn't read a barcode and the other one would
Why on earth do you need to read my contact info AND my browser history? This has to be the worst app ever.
Your permissions are bullshit. Uninstalling.
Doesn't work on Jelly Bean 4.1.1
Didn't work , took forever to scan
I only just started using this app recently,yes I know I'm late. Turns out though that it's incredibly easy and anyone can use it.
Pls have an update for ICS
Came pre-installed with the phone. Is rarely able capture a code. Kept it on the phone because of the clock which was just a nice size but that has now frozen for the second time. Will be removing the app as i have now found a much better scanner that works every time
I have a brand new HTC EVO and this QR reader barely worked on my phone. It took forever trying to read the code then it wouldn't give me any information back. #HatedIt!
Its scaning very bad, sometimes doesn't scan, or show the wrong page
Works well
got sick of waiting minutes to finish the scan.. got other app, done in 2 secs max...
....by other Apps (by other people).  For example ..Att code reader......QR Barcode Scanner.    Therefore serves no purpose as a generated.   Reader works fine.
Won't even start
Crashed second time i used. Couldnt make it open again. Crap
Garbage. Uninstall.
Garbage. Uninstall.
poor
Its pointless I have galaxy s n it wont let me update n all my phone does is waste internet telling me I have a update but I cant even update it sort it out or ill have to uninstall
This app does not use australia  pricing and is completely usless.freezes non stop as well.
Very good okay
I noticed when i went to share a pic from my gallery,there was all the normal options such as share via Bluetooth or facebook. Then i saw a huge section of chinese symbols! Like maybe 30 secs worth of scrolling. I bet u can guess which app was the culprit. Uninstalled
Warning! If you use this program DO NOT UPDATE! Latest update brings you bugs and some of features stop working. Thanks god i have 5.1 version backup. They were the best, now they turned into baggy, lack of functions software. Also support don't reply on emails.
This is bad update one App keep loading when gen QR and getting history it keep me wait for long time and end by auto exit Application . What a shame!
After installing this app on my phone, wildfire S, my camera no longer works. It can take photos but view is pure white, I'm shooting in the white so to speak.
Keeps thinking on S3!
However for privacy reasons I must subtract 4 points.
Can't uninstall it.
Struggles to read the simplest qr codes, every other reader I've used manages fine.
Download scanner app, scan, download 17mb app, doesnt work.  No thanks.
At all.
Works a little slowly. Hope the update fix it.
Before I give 5 star, but after the latest update...the history just keep loading than app auto exit!! Pls fix it...or no choice BUT HAVE TO UNINSTALL.
Was a great app. Now its not.
The new update is not working
like so many other people have stated after the update I could not use it, no use in having an app that I cannot use
This sucks!!!
Liked it when worked. Now I get BS message that it requires features not found on my phone. Uninstall.  .
With the latest update, this appear has been rendered inoperable on all but Ice Cream Sandwich android phones.  Deleting with extreme prejudice.
Not compatible with Android 2.2
Latest update incompatible with my phone? Thank you for including all your customer base in your latest update. Used to be good, now only 1* until this issue is resolved
Used to work fine on my triumph. Now it says i cant use features or some bs. Good to know a brand new phone is already obsolete.. 1star for unusable app. Uninstalled.
Why would this app need access to all your personal info? Browser history and contacts list? No thanks...
Unable to scan any qr code
All this stupid app does is blink and flash... It will not scan anything.
Never completes the scan!
This used to be much better with earlier versions.  SGS2/ICS.
It's a piece of crap it takes freaking 2 years just to scan one thing
Never works. Galaxy Nexus
Was working, now won't open at all. I tried uninstall/reinstall to no avail. Wish it would work, I loved it before.

It is what it is. Has tons of features and works great.
Love the option for flashlight
On Android v2.2 HTC desire
This app has not been able to scan any QR codes
Tried at least 7 times and it wont work uninstalling after 10 mins of use"!!! Takesss wayyy too long
cant scan.
This app works great on my Samsung Galaxy S2, but doesn't read any codes on my Galaxy S3.
Normally brilliant camera refuses to focus on QR code and app has no manual override - rubbish!
Would not scan anything.... downloaded the warriors qr code scanner & it worked great!
Was holding infront of my LAPPY for ages. Could not scan the code
Which was the last time. No patience for stuff trhat doesn't work.
Doesn't work on any QR code I've tried it on.
Takes forever to scan and with no results. HTC EVO 4G
Slow, focusing hard, drains battery.  My droid X is awesome, and this app needs help.
Not sure what the problem is, but app just doesn't scan codes for crap!
Does not work on droid x
Uninstalled.
Junk! :O  doesn't even work, days scanning but nothing happens! Waste of time!
Solves all your QR Codes needs
Great to transfer contacts DROID phone.
Can't open it and when it does, it fc. Please fix Evo 3d
does exactly what it says
I have tried in all sorts of light, magazines, paper, cardboard, just everything i can find just to try it out. No success at all, not even one scan
sloppy programing, doesn't read clear well lighted qr code. trash.
Tried to scan a few codes.  Only one was recognized after scanning for a long time.  My friend used his Nokia Lumia and took less than a second to read the code.  I then tried using Google goggles, it read in speed of light. What's wrong QR Droid?
this app takes way to long to scan.
Needs too many permissions:  Read Browser's history and bookmarks Allows the app to read all the URLs that the Browser has visited, and all of the Browser's bookmarks.  No way!
Redlaser and scanlife and barcode scanner work in a spit second redlaser has local. This never worked.  I tested it with three products. Should have a negative rating
Works great
Can't read qr code from xda developers
Didn't scan majority of QR Codes presented
Not working with my phone
takes too long
Really doesn't do a lot, waste of memory on my phone if you ask me!
I've tried many times to scan, different positions, lighting, etc..  Never EVER works.  Save yourself the frustration.
Just keep scanning n scanning on my SGS3..
Just works
It cant scan. It zoom and rezooming very long with no result.
The app that i really need ... Free and no ads
It's sad that this seems to have stopped working.  I  can barely get It to scan a QR code.  Mobitag and the US post office app work faster.  I'll keep It on my phone to generate QR codes only as that is all It's good for now

I couldn't get this to work on my HTC EVO 4G after many tries.  I installed a QR Reader in my girlfriend's iPhone and it was up and running in less than 3 minutes.
My camera's focus keeps spazzing out in this app, making it unusable  Also, like many apps not optimised for this phone, there is a bar on the bottom of the screen that does nothing

Doesn't work on my HTC Desire.
I've never used a qr scanner before, but I tried this on a blind recommendation, and it wouldn't scam the thing, it was top busy refocusing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over,etc
Does not work.
I've never been able to see if the program actually works.  It's at least 10x slower than Google Goggles.
Doesn't seem to work. All it does is re focus. Never scans
Had to download this to work with another app.  After several minutes if trying to scan a QR code, I finally gave up. Should have read the other reviews first, could have saved me the hand cramps.
Sat there for a few minutes and it didnt load...
...
It's pretty good i guess.
After 5 minutes of holding my phone trying to get this app to scan a Q code it was still trying to focus. I exited and immediatly uninstalled
I got two qr apps at the same time, and scanned the same image. Qr scanner instantly recognised the very codes and qr droid focus and unfocused till my arms started aching. It's like comparing Internet explorer with firefox/chrome. It's that bad.
Have to take a photo first then scan it. Not good
Just ad support made look a but UNCOMFORTABLE on small screen, rest is cool
Could you scan a simple black and white qr code or any custom codes
Useless....cant scan on my ray st18i....
Does what it's supposed to do. Reading times are a bit painful though. I'd still say it's one of the best.

I would not recommend this app to anyone. It takes FOREVER to recognize a code and once it does it doesn't give any prompts about getting the info from it. Too slow and too hard to use.
Addon detector reported this app installing with access to the contacts DB and browser history. Browser history might be excusable, but there's no benign reason to check contacts.
Never stops trying to focus. Unable to use it.
It won't let me scan nothin
It won't let me scan nothin

Didn't work...
Worked 1 out of 10 times and even then it took FOREVER. Uninstalling.
It will be focused then out of focus, then focused, then not.  I never scanned.  You are the weakest link, goodbye
Droid incredible....won't scan, just keeps focusing..uninstalling
Used to work well then died on EVO 4G. Upgraded to EVO LTE and still can't scan any codes.
Needs to be positioned too precisely and for too long to be comfortable.
The app never works for me.
It takes hours to scan. Shopsavy is the best for scan qr and bar codes..
Let it sit for 5 minutes, and nothing! 0 stars
Auto focuses in and out without completing a scan...please fix
Sucks ! Does not scan
Took too long trying to focus. I tried another app that was much quicker
Does nit work anymore. If you try to start it directly crashes.
Doesnt work
So installed.
Great app. Does everything it says it does.
It was great app. Unfortunately since recent updates don't scan anymore :(
Don't work
Mine scanned one time and wouldnt scan anything else.
Boo! I had this before I did a hard reset and had to reinstall.  What happened to the version that worked?
I installed this and tried scanning a few codes but it would never read them. Uninstalled and reinstalled and stilll cannot get any type of qr to read. Phones new and has no problems with other aps so I don't know what the problem is.
Good app, except that it apsolutely freezes my phone when i want to launch it, Which is terribly annoying and frustrating! I figure it launches the camera first. Well what if I want to scan a screenshot...? Not good psychology mechanism you have here. It was great on the older version, when I had a f.. choice and ease of use. ~evo 3D.
Codes that CAN be scanned just fine with other scanners won't scan.
I was never able to actually scan a code with this app. Switching over to the one my husband uses. It actually works!
Poor. Doesn't scan. Refocusing is the only thing this app does. Other Qr scanning app works well.
Great app...works fine Droid Bionic
Doesn't read the barcodes
Time widget always goes out od sync. Complicated menu to navigate. Needs more polishing.
I've tried several codes and done of them work any one suggest what I've done
Worked fine until last update. Now won't scan a thing... :-(
I don't like it at all. It doesn't read the codes
Didn't work on my HTC desire
Failed to read a QR code that Google Goggles managed to read.
Why this app requires to read browser history and bookmarks????? Why it requires to read contacts data???? Suspicious!! Uninstalled!!
Not working on my phone. Can't seem to scan
Did not scan
I like all the options and the fact you can use it as the long press default for search button, but it doesn't scan! Glitch maybe? Galaxy S II X
Force close every time I scan.(Droid X2).  Not worth troubleshooting since there are many other apps out there that work.  Uninstalled immediately.
Try AT&T's qr reader. Much better!
Like it a great app.
Doesn't work. Droid razr.
All it does is keep re focusing and never stops. Uninstalling
Doesn't work on my HTC
Can't recommend enough, will produce, scan and read all in one app. Only one thing would make it better, the option to create multi colour codes.
Unistalled
Sucks! Won't scan!
Does not read qr codes
There is no reason to allow this app to share my contact information.
Why the update is 4 times in size the app? Solution: advertisers orders! Don't update!
Bad recognition
Was working fine.  but since last update doesnt scan well and u have to put the green linein the bottom and even it sometimes wont work
Sorry, Not very good at scanning
Sorry, Not very good at scanning
Changed to this from another one and this one hasn't read several qr codes. Don't waste your time with it.
Do not understand why this app needs to read my contacts and browser history ...  Removed ... I'll use another app
No matter what i do, it will not scan. Horrible app.
Piece of garbage.  Does not work at all.
Installing this app messed up my phone. It could no longer take, send, or receive photos
Its disgusting
Droid 2 it had epilepsy er something :(
On my droid x. Not sure why.
simple but nice.
Crashes every single time
Doesn't work on HTC sensation,just crashes the phone.
Eh
I updated my qr droid and it disappeared! I the had to download it again. Total waste of time!
Intrusive Updates.These people want your contact information! Seriously? What's up with that? Am uninstalling & going for a more private app.
Forget the latest update. I'm not giving it my browser history. This program just got way too nosey!!
Why do u need my contacts
Try it did not like it flooding my phone with ads about badoo uninstalling going back to barcode do not download waste time
Crap uninstall. Quickmark is way better!
Updated app on my HTC Sensation and now it does not work. This app was nice, Uninstalled!!!
my choice qr scanner and is perfectly adfree with the adfree android app thanks to root
Just constantly tries to focus on the image but never does anything
Very useful it works perfectly
Very useful it works perfectly
Samsung galaxy tab 10.1  I cant use all the buttons below. Not useful anymore. Dear developer, pls do something about it.
It sucks balls
What on earth for?! I guess you think your users are stupid or crasy...well, I guess anyone who installs this probably is.
App doesn't always open qr codes,it just gives codes Not film.Is this a code fault or an app fault ?
Will not scan anything.!!!  I downloaded this app hoping it would be better than the private. But this app is just as useless!!! Uninstalled!!!
Didnt scan anything!!
Why does this app have access to personal Info?? UNINSTALLING!
This is no where near a good as RED Scanner !! This is cumbersome and hard work to get prices quickly even then they are in dollars... it links to USA shopping sites...Get RED SCANNER instead much better
Flash does not work in.....galaxy ace
Works when you want to use it but seems to want to be used all the time..... opens itself randomly! Annoying, uninstall.
Uninstalling this app! You do not need that much info about me!!!
Why does a barcode scanner need access to my browser history and personal data?? I don't think so!!
Works great!!
After last two updates ot does not scan feckin anythin.
sucks
It wont even load crap!!! Anf ut wont let me delete it
Gimmick!
Great app.stop far the adds don't bother me enough to buy the upgrade
Love it works
Love it works
Using Android EVO
Very unreliable.  Slow.
Caused frequent FCs on my Sony Xperia 10 running Android 2.3
Very dissapointed. Froze my phone 4x in a row. Fix this bug, since it's not ICS friendly. (Samsung Galaxy)
App never worked for me.
i hope this fad dies soon.
Apparently this app signs you up for some text service about Cat Facts.  Haven't gotten to use the app but have 45 texts on Cat Facts!
Ads won't let you proceed with testing
I scan a code and it force closes
nice, but useful
Waste of time on samsung galaxy tab
Multistage process interrupted with mandatory pop up ad clicks. Don't bother!
Scans qr code but when you try to open the url, it mmediately closes the browser making scanning the code useless
The camera flash buggs out
Will not scan code tried multiple times
Sucks on my incredible try it on five different items   And only thang that happened was my ARM getting tired from holding up my phone
Terrible . Will no scan.
Do not want ability to invade privacy by access of camera to see at anytime what my phone see's so had to uninstall. Really wanted to keep the app.
Amazingly quick. Galaxy s.
New version sucks!!! Can't change camera 2 back camera which was correct. Uninstalled. Dumbies
Why do you want to know my personal info, days and browser history? BS. I'm uninstalling
Why do you need access to my contacts? Uninstalling.
Don't know why this app needs to know all of my bookmarks and browser history. Unacceptable. Uninstalling.
Works like a dream
Have used a few other QR readers. Like this one the best. Has more features than the others.
I have not been able to scan ANY QR codes.  Uninstall. Droid X user.
Doesn't work for me.
It works as described
Terrible...never works
Long way to product price.
Accesses your browsing history and contacts!  Im not exposing family and friends to their marketing.  Uninstalling this otherwise good app.
Good user interface for beginners and plenty of features for more experienced users.
Does not work on DROID x
...esp. in light of all the new scanning features for downloading, info gathering, etc.
Worth trying
This app seems to fc every single time I get it to read a code. Shame it looks quite good. Motorola Atrix

This app is crap. Will not do what it claims.
Can't find the the qr code when I download it.says its saved to sd but WHERE THE HELL IS IT! UNINSTALL
Foreclose everytime I scan, a barcode..... Motorola Atrix
This worked great before the update. Now its useless, ugh!
Useless, need a barcode application that gives me the dollar price
Starts to go to web then forgets everything. HTC thunderbolt.
App sucks after the latest update.  It wont read codes, flashlight feature turns to strobing and completely white screen can't see the code.Fail updat
Does it all. I would like to see Microsoft tag compatibility, bit other than that, have nothing to complain about. 5 stars all day.
Junk. It worked once snd I can't get it to work again.
Try to get the scan thru for 5 mins nothin uninstall
Right part of camera image is corrupted when i'm trying to recognize code from camera. Previous versions worked fine.  ZTE Blade cmod 7.
Either the Moto Droid is a POS or these scan aps are just crap. None work on the QR codes.
Doesn't open or read
Doesn't work at all.
Since the latest 'update', I can't get any real code info on my DROID X2. Instead of useful info, nonsense comes on the screen.
Best code app I've downloaded!
Last major update gave it a better UI but lost some functionality. Can't even create your own QR codes anymore. *un-installing now*
Does not work at all...Droid X2...green scan bar comes up but app does not open camera for scanning.
Does not seem to work.  Isn't able to scan qr codes.  Just goes in and out of focus.  Does nothing.  Droid 2
I liked the app but I never allow permission to view my personal information.  Too risky.  Change that and I'll install.
Scanner first barcode, now won't scan! Not impressed :(
Doesn't work for me. I tried different distances from the code..... nothing.
It just keeps trying to focus and doesn't scan the QR at all. Terrible app. Droid 2 global
Pfft. Next.
I have to hold so still to use this app... maybe its my phone. But its annoying! I prop my phone up on stuff to read codes. Always refocusing.
Used this app for about half a year without a single issue.
A real good app, its great that you can make them too
Simply the best QR app 4 android
I really like the new interface
After download I got 3 more apps installed w/o permission. Kickback,  soundback, and gmail... Wtf? I don't want your crap! Deleting all 4 now
Freezes me up on occasion but otherwise decent
Forse closes on X10...
Doesn't work
It will not upload any picture I have to the server to make a qr link
Love it!
Terrible....suck big time...dosent work....
Apps that ask me to leave a review are annoying. Here's one star.
Stop forcing updates down my throat
I don't like how it updates automatically and NO OPTION to turn this off. UnInstall!
This app used to be great; nice simple interface, everything on one page, no ads, no data mining. I wish I could go back to the old version.
Only QR scanner that has ever worked for me. Tried goggles and a few others. This is the one. ;) great work. Evo 4g and 2.3.4
Yet to scan a code.

G2X
Works great for me!
Blurry from this size! _
U dont understand it bleh!!!
Very handy at times does what its supposed to do.
Camera just keeps trying to focus, even when I put it in macro (close up) mode. Samsung Galaxy S2.
awesome little app
Updated in less than 30 sec. I use this app all the time! Thx.
After scanning barcode, it doesn't even show the price of products....uninstalled
Works perfect on my Droid X
Sucks
Its so easy to use and saves everything in the history for you to use later...
Do not use often but when I do it does its job!
good app... but there are better that do not have busty lady ads... not really appropriate for a business phone
I tried to scan it for 20 minutes, followed all the instructions, it NEVER worked
Works just like its supposed to.
Worthless
What da hell is this?
It worked beautifully before the update, but not when I scan something it won't even load. I'm left with a blank screen
Was a good app before the update. Now when I scan something it force closes everytime
What is the justification for sneaking access to comtacts into the update?
Uninstalled
Sucks. It will never scan using my droid x.
I don't use it that much so I can give in less than 5 stars in silicon a bug
is so wack it doesnt even work a waste of time installing this app
So, where are my dirty little secrect photos at? I cant find them anywhere on my htc evo. Unistall. Waste of time and a lil nervous where R my secrets
Best Qr app I've found.
Rubbish takes ages t do th actual scan nd even thn it doesn't wrk! Dnt botha dwnlding it.

i dont see why everyone is complaining. its perfect.
This program doesn't make cheese appear at my request.
In my opinion they did away w/the most important and most desired part of the app, and that is the ability to create are codes. Why?
Not the best app hard to use and not fast but gets job done so it is ok
serves purpose well but it doesn't have a friendly or instinctive user interface
I have tried this ap at least a dozen times where a friend with an I-phone can read a QR code and this app on my Droid2 cannot. Goodbye lame app ....
This app requires way too many permissions ; Why does it need access to my contacts?!?!
I don't kno weather it is good or bad b/c I downloaded but never used. I am jurck
Hate this app ruined my phone
Excellent app, it does what it says, and it does it well.
I LOVE the update changes! This is THE best QR reader/ writer on Android! :D
:))
Wow this is the most amazing QR reader in android hands down! Love the new UI! Thanks!
Was looking for an app to read the codes. This one does it but has too much stuff that i dont use. Looking for a simple app, not over complicated.
have to hold my phone 30-45 so it can scan the QRcode during all that time it scan in and out with lots of lite blue dot flashing all over the place. I am using an LG Optimus 2x with 2 core which is one of the fastest phone those days!
This is a great tool! And its fun, too!
It's a very good app. Works well for the Incredible S
It's a very good app. Works well for the Incredible S
Allows me to create my own codes and save to JPG or BMP! Best decoer/encoder!
Wouldn't work on my Droid X. Tried several different tags. It just keeps scanning over & over.
Wouldn't work on my Droid X. Tried several different tags. It just keeps scanning over & over.
I tried i-nigma first and it did nto work with my phone - could not access the camera. They claim compatibility with Japanese phones, and mine is an LG Optimus which is Korean origin. Anyway, this one works great and is fast. I would have installed the V4 Beta if I had seen it. I like that DroidLa gives the app for free, then you can choose to stop the ADs and promote the project by sending $1.50+ by PayPal to get a code to enter. Recommended by PC Mag is also encouraging.
The only thing that could improve would be the ability to manually select the error correction

Awesome app! Create and decode on the fly. I use it for promotions and I also capture codes while I'm out and about.
It never scans any codes. Gets blurry and then clear, only to do it all over again

Just scan the bar code. Don't need duplicates of what my phone already has. Waste of space - delete
Web search icon not shown When scanning from camera

Yesterday I downloaded it and it wouldn't work. For some reason today it works perfectly
Blurred when using camera to decode any code using my MotoBlur or Flipside. Does NOT work!!!
Very good QR scanner. Has been able to scan arcades in low light that other apps couldn't. You can manually turn on theft light when scanning.
This app is simple to use. It also detects the qr code quickly without any trouble.

Does exactly what I need it to do. I recommend this app for anyone looking to generate or use barcodes.
I wish doctors receptionist would use this... I could take a picture of my next appointment.... imports directly to my calendar with prescription info
Really great app! There too many tools for my taste since I only needed to scan stuff, but then I found that I can create a shortcut to just the scan
I'll give the developer credit for a clear and easy to use interface but it would not scan a qr code from my brother and my phones...both have DROID X
Easily store contacts, mails, urls and simple text. Can really fit many chars in txt recognition.
Creating and scanning works flawlessly, allows shortcuts to specific functions for the home screen which I think is really useful. Scan time isn't always consistently short but it always does the job. Running on galaxy S2.
Camera just keeps changing focus... in the 10 or so times i tried to use it over a 4 month period it never once successfully scanned a QR code
Good for codes but pops up every time you hold search button very annoying (wildfire)
Ads are nonobtrusive, and the app is quick.
Works good. Just h aad hard time getting the phone to focus. Fixed it by making sure all the other things the camera saw were the same distance.
Takes ages to scan anything for me, if at all. Have found a faster replacement app. HTC Desire.
Not working on desire at all. Wont decode pics or work on cam.... Its on a taco bell cup that specifically says QR code...

Great must have, but needs some way to scroll the text you get after decrypting a image. Also, the codes should go to gallery so you can view them.
I use this with 'mybookdroid' instead of the default. It works very well, has better personalization options and is much better as a stand-alone too.
Have u ever heard of don't judge a book by its cover try don't judge a app by its cover!!!!
This is the best qr shop on android. This is also the official one. I highly suggest it.
It is a very good app for some reson. Even fun it takes 2sec to make a 2d barcode and share it
Works well when I can get it to recognize a code. Most of the time blue dots just keep jumping all over the screen. Not sure if it's my camera or the app.
I paid for the ad remove code but never received it. Now in dispute with pay pal to get my money back... waste of time what a rip off... Don't Pay for a code.

Tried this on two different codes and was not able to read any of them useless app
Not crazy about these codes, wish there was just download links but this app works great.
Does not work on HTC Hero. Camera won't scan codes. It just keeps refocusing camera.
I downloaded this because I wanted a QR reader, but this turned out to be significantly more. Reads and generates all forms of QR. Excellent.
WARNING, this is malware. After installing it, it said I "had a message", stupid me clicked on it and it began downloading something strange
Tried scanning QR codes tons of times but each time it would just keep trying to get it into focus
Havent had any problems. I guess its my stupidity but it took me a long time to figure out how to scan...but otherwise no problems
Gives back no results plus I had to guess how to use it horrible. .
This doesn't work as well as others at SCANNING a QR code. This app is presumably best at creating codes but I haven't tried that yet.

Thiw app is not what I thoughr it would be. It doesn't read all the scanner boxes on every product you want to get info on. Very seldom works!
Downloaded it to take qr code pics when reading about apps... worked flowlessly, but used only once so far.

I guess I'm totally a dingbat cuz I'm not sure what its supposed to do.
Cool. Couldn't find a single other app that can turn things into a qr code awesome
I do not understand how it works. I sat there for 5 minutes while it flashed my flash.
It scanned but after installation it jacked up my phone after each use. Constantly caused it to reboot uninstalled and phone is back to normal-droid x
All I get is info without ability to "scan" anything. Too bad I can't rate it a ZERO. using droid X

Couldn't get it to scan a single QR code. Just kept trying to focus. Sounded great but even the help was no help.
Works rather nice. The only reason i am not giving it 5 stars, is that the UI is kind of crap.

Sucks won't focus or scan codes. Maybe its my error but since there is no info what to do I'll never know.
Love the application. I have installed it on my Galaxy Tab as well; it is very handy to have!
It would be a really nice feature to be able to generate a QR code for a contacts group. Other than that, extremely useful application
I first came across this on a PC and found it to be great for so many uses, then I came across this in the market place it great on to Galaxy S. dcsi.
didnt work, the camera didnt take pictures and it couldnt decode any either huawei droid

On first code it didn't work. On second one it didn't work either. Uninstalled. Droid X
Really great functionality and complete app. I'm afraid there are some power drainage issues though. Tired of force closing, I'll need a substitute.
Went to old navy and needed this AP. It uploaded quickly a d worked perfectly. And I am not a tech-savvy person.
Bug found in app created n saved url image can not be decoded due to too many data... have to use other reader or open from history file.
Doesnt work at all. No glare. Perfect picture, or holding it from of the camera. Dont waste your time
These [QRimages] are notorious for their being difficult to get working properly for some reason. This application is good to have & works great!
Amazingly well done. Wish there were more apps this well made on the market. Bang up work.
Works much better than other scanners I've tried. Integrates well with other programs.
When I scanned it would go to unwanted ads, and asked if I wanted to purchase a code. Did not like

So far it's working great, only used it a couple of times, no problems yet on froyo samsung vibrant
Sweet app, works better than I had expected with a load of extra features too. :-)
Pretty flipping nifty app. Only think that would make it better is of you could convert images into codes
Very nice program! Conveniently create your own QR Code for your friends to scan instead of type in!
This program took 11% of my battery today and I only used it once in the 8 hours on my battery.
The camera wouldn't take the picture after 30 sec. Of focusing. Sorry but it's a dud. Samsung intercept
Works every time without any problems. I also Luke that you can make your own. My friends like to send messages to each other with it. :-)
This is a great app! I had the Microsoft tag reader app first, and it doesn't even compare
I so far have not been able to get it to scan a single code
Good but setup of main screen could be better but other than than that pretty good

Will not work on Motorola Flipside. Camera does not focus on objects up close. Not the fault of app, phone's problem.
I am so loving this scanner app! Easy & fun to use. Those fancy barcodes are everywhere now. Sometimes I scan ads I don't even care for just for fun!

Why does a qr code reader need to access all of my contact data. #fail
Got everything i need!
But half the time doesn't read codes, no matter you angle or light on or off
Wow. What a space waster. I loved this before, uninstalling.
Works well, but doesn't respect default app selection.
Good program HOWEVER currently having trouble using all the functions on my LG revolution. At least Pic to QRcode and contact info to QRCode aren't working right. I'll update this review once bugs/functionality are worked out. PS. if they don't work on account of user error then you may want to look into making your interface a bit easier to use.
Doesn't work most of the time. Very frustrating!!!
Doesn't work on most items but the ATT reader is able too scan.
P
When it works it is fine, that just isn't very often.

Please I beg of the developers, please post the same version on Google Play and the Amazon App Store.  Every other day I get a different build from one store or the other.  It's a royal pain.  Until then you lose 2 stars.  Update:  yet another new build that conflicts with Amazon store.  Now you lose 3 stars.
"Application requires features not available on your device"  What features? Camera, wifi, 3G, SD card, flashlight - I have all those. What gives?
Used to work now can't update...features not available on your device...HTC inspire
5 out of the last 6 scans failed
Not work :(
Takes too much time compared to other apparently and doesn't read it sometimes.
Reads codes occasionally and only with much encouragement. The code looks great on the screen of my phone and it looks like its reading quickly but then without fail it will yank itself out of focus and start over, and it will continue this cycle forever. Not useful to me cuz it seriously takes less time and effort to type a url.
This _was_ the best QR app for Android. But each update adds more bugs than features. Scanning now so slow and unreliable as to be useless. Widgets are a nice idea but have too many screen-refresh issues to bother with.
Works half the time.
Worked OK on my ASUS SL101 until the ICS update was installed.  Now it can't open the camera which makes it useless.
Nice interface. Very slow and finicky scanning. Other scanners are quite a bit better.
Used to like it but the interface is really bad and it keeps crashing.
Doesn't work with a crap.  Stupid auto focus never stops focusing so it can scan.  Waaaay too picky/sensitive. Not really useful/usable at all.
Slick UI, runs smoothly, but impossible to recommend, because it is rarely able to actually scan a code.
After using this for a while, I switched to Microsoft Tag. It was much faster and had more variety. I didn't like how QR droid only scanned the QR codes. I felt like I was missing out because I could only scan certain ones. Also it was painfully finicky and often wouldn't scan for me. Very frustrating. The Microsoft Tag app scans much easier. While this app served its purpose, I would not recommend it.
I uninstalled this straight away. Was very slow to scan!
Good for generating QR codes on your phone, but the scanner NEVER works.
...but no longer. Not sure when it went bad, but I just tried to read some QR Codes with it and no luck. Same QR Codes were scanned successfully with QR Barcode Scanner. It's a shame, as the UI for that app is horrible compared to this...
Scanning
Im deleting it because of the ads in the notification bar.
Takes a long time to scan, and misses part of the vcard
Neo reader is far faster than this. Anyway useful app but needs improvement
Can't share what I scanned on Facebook
With so many QR codes out there, I installed this app. Unfortunately it had trouble reading most of the QR codes I came across. Tried different angles but not much luck. I had better luck with "Barcode Scanner" app from zxing. Wont comment on the new app until I've used it for a while.
Slow to scan QR codes.
I checked this application on several devices. HTC phones and Samsung tablet. It worked perfectly well on HTC with Android 2.5 and on tablet with Android 3.2, but it does not work on HTC One X with Android 4. It constantly hunts for focus, gets it very seldom, drains out battery, overloads focusing mechanizm. Result is negative. It works fine if a picture of 2D code is taken by regular camera application and then read by QR Droid application, but this workaround is not up to my taste. Have to uninstall it..
Pretty cool, i love it great 1'd it
This has so many awesome features but I rarely get to use them since it rarely is able to decode what I scan: no matter how easy it should be.
Love the app but will be sadly uninstalling due to the fact it can read my contacts' details. Why?
Can't download this app and I need it in my life!
Works perfectly on my Galaxy Note, but I don't like the way it opens a link to click on rather than simply going directly to the video/website. I think I shall try another QR Reader, instead
Giving a low rating because it accesses information on your phone that ttthe program doesn't need, namely your   browsing history. Tried contacting developers to ask why but emailt bounced because the address listed here is not valid.
Please ! How can i scan with this program
Does not read QR Codes on the Defy (green lens)
Run
Keep in mind that I am not saying this is a bad app, just that it didn't work.  I am sure it is my economy priced phone (Samsung Intercept) that's the problem which is why I gave it a 2 star mark rather than a 1 star
Awesome app never have problems
It works but ads are so annoying and contribute to battery drain that I uninstalled it.
Why does it need my personal information??!!!??!!
Updated to 4.5 together with Android V4.0.3. QRDroid no longer recognises the camera.
Does not work. Looks like a great app though.
This app is getting more annoying, the longer I have it.....used to work perfectly, now works about 40% of the time. Will take 1 pic, then lock up, or take all 3, but not save. Also, its lame that you have to edit the pic RIGHT THEN, if you save and then go back, you can use the HDR editing. Needs fixing.
Deleting message from the list of messages throws you to the beginning of the list. Messages reappear after deletion.

Everything about this app is great... EXCEPT that the camera doesn't work! It DID say it takes control of camera and other hardwares, but it doesn't let me take pics?! Then why is there a "Decode Saved QR image" if you can't save anything on it? Fail...
I love the idea of this app, especially good for business, but have to say that my Droid2 started acting erratically after installing it.  My phone is fine after uninstalling.  Hope the developers take note.
This app installs too many action handlers... I don't want it on the search menu, I don't want it handling gallery photos.  It's not helpful, it's annoying.
Nice explanation of how to scan qr code. However on the thrive it did not want to read any qr codes. Another program I tried did just fine.
Fast, complete and simple. Perfect.
Works good on myTouch 4G slide. I use it more every day as more companies use QR codes.
Right part of camera image is corrupted when i'm trying to recognize code from camera. Previous versions worked fine.  ZTE Blade cmod 7.
Doesn't work!
Makes the codes but won't decode, just blanks back to gallery. Droid 2.
Why this apps needs to access my personal information, contact list and history??
Cool
No option for 2D bar codes. Uninstalled
Why does the app need to access my internet history?
Data mining!
The remove adds for FREE does not work ----_ rather suspicious
Worked for a while, then it said I needed an additional app for it to do anything useful. Droid x
Yet to scan a code.
Explain why this program needs access to contact information? Uninstalled it.
I would rate higher if map also had sat view
Works like a charm!
I tried to scan it for 20 minutes, followed all the instructions, it NEVER worked
Works perfectly, quickly and with remarkable precision on the HTC Thunderbolt.
Works really well on Dell Streak (2.2.2). On line QR code generator is useful too.
Keeps Freezing
Used to work on my Eris but last two upgrades have somehow rendered it useless.
It bored me , i didnt get the point of this app .
i dont see why everyone is complaining. its perfect.
Scans about half the time. Found a much better and faster app for QR Codes.
With latest update lost ability TO CREATE A CODE? F A I L!! Uninstalled and chose another app.
Not the best app hard to use and not fast but gets job done so it is ok
It could be 5 from me, but it's slow sometimes, and it keeps saying I have an available update when I don't, requiring a reinstall.

Works great rooted HTC EVO
Not really sure if this is the problem, but my camera has been freezing up ever since i installed this app on my droid.uninstallin
It's fine until the 15th use, then out fogs up the camera with a graphic.
Gets the job done if you can wait around for a few minutes for it to recognize the QR. Camera keeps focusing and unfocusing. Found better app.

When scanning from camera, places the "Scan from url" image on top of the image so you can't see what you're scanning. Please fix! HTC EVO 4G, Sprint.
Just want a scanner this thing got my contacts and everything else on 1 screen worked on a papa johns box
Awesome app. Very simply to use. Works great with my HTC Evo and Xoom.
If you need an app that can handle QR codes you could do a lot worse than this. A good app with a lot of source options.
Very cool app. I love it and use it every chance I get. A must have app for every android!
Ads are nonobtrusive, and the app is quick.
cool app, being able to turn anything into a barcode thingy (dont know the term) is very usefull.
Its brilliant try it on your driving license it comes up with your number, works quick and gives special offers sometimes.

Great must have, but needs some way to scroll the text you get after decrypting a image. Also, the codes should go to gallery so you can view them.
this app works great...(Zio)
Can't even scan a code in a magazine. Tries and tries even in great light and nothing. Just focusing Time to try another scanner this one's a POS.
Downloaded it to take qr code pics when reading about apps... worked flowlessly, but used only once so far.
I can't find my vcard but I did just get this app. Have not played with it much yet!
Does not scan all codes. Takes a long to focus and scan when it decides to work.
Awesome app. Very easy to use. Don't even need instructions to be able to use it
Its an ok app but does make it a bit confusing at first. You just have to mess aroun with it.
A little tough to learn but once I get it figured out I think it will be great
Not a bad app. Not all that useful unless all ur friends can scan QRs. Wish saved codes would go into the gallery tho
Google Shopper (or ANY shopping app) integration desperately needed. Does everything Barcode Scanner doesn't. Still can't really replace it.
Doesn't feel very user friendly. I need something I can use quick without a learning curve.
After downloading and extensively testing all the available free barcode and QR code scanners, this one is definitely the best.
Works like a charm! Just snap a photo of the barcode and "POOF" it will show you the URL or translated barcode number.
Went to old navy and needed this AP. It uploaded quickly a d worked perfectly. And I am not a tech-savvy person.
Bug found in app created n saved url image can not be decoded due to too many data... have to use other reader or open from history file.
Nice program. The last version impro ed the performance. Almost every time does the things it is supposed to do.
Sweet app, works better than I had expected with a load of extra features too. :-)
Seems like it could be useful but was the last app i installed and fone is now lagging. Will uninstall and see if this is the culpit samsung galaxy
I immediately recognized the QR code in the Stephen Colbert Friday skit. My droid with this app did not. Failure. Nice interface, though
This is a great app! I had the Microsoft tag reader app first, and it doesn't even compare
I tried to scan a code for bikefest and was given an error code- something about there being too much information?
Works grate on android apex so far no problems scans bar codes better then barcode scanner

So so. Can do
Hard to scan some qr codes.
Should be able to retrieve saved qr codes from within app.
Good program HOWEVER currently having trouble using all the functions on my LG revolution. At least Pic to QRcode and contact info to QRCode aren't working right. I'll update this review once bugs/functionality are worked out. PS. if they don't work on account of user error then you may want to look into making your interface a bit easier to use.
Works but a little slow...
Even though it "can" take a few seconds to "lock in", It's terrific!  The only thing I would update is for the app NOT to "remember" the last scan as soon as the app opens. It's a little bit of a pain to have to back out of the app 1 or 2 times to get it to default to the scanning function, but it's still VERY worth 5 stars!
Puts an unnecessary ton of new widgets you will have to scroll through to get past Q in the list.
Don't use often but works great when in use. No problem with update Samsung galaxy II
Generates codes like a charm, but can't do anything with them when scanning them in. Found the whole experience very confusing. Really only got this to read and write QR codes, but a has load of other features that seem superfluous and arbitrary, and doing anything with scanned data is a real challenge. Still a lot better than any similar program I've seen to-date, however.
Great
Good for shortcuts to websites
Reads qr fine. But the qr generator keeps erroring out
Works a little slowly. Hope the update fix it.
I used to be able to use this app, but since the latest update came out, I'm not able to update it cause I get an error that says: App requires features not avaliable on your device. Galaxy S(Captivate 2.2)
Used to be perfect; updated happily with each update bringing useful changes. Now, however, the recent update was not compatible. My phone attempted to update it it but the failed attempt has stopped it working. Upsetting but what can you do? 3* as whilst it's kaput it was fantastic.
Continually autofocuses,  doesn't actually capture an image. Will work if the qr code doesn't fill the screen, but if this us the case, the screen box should be altered toreflect that fact.

Couldn't scan at all. Switched to another app and scan worked fine. Not recommended, uninstalled
it never scans anything, all it does is refocus the camera
Great app, just so painfully slow when scanning
...it does what it is designed to. Had to reinstall twice because it wouldn't recognize anything at some point. Card making option is a cool idea. Steamingly outspatches the hot hilliotts in our cubbled petchrarch. Feedbag!!!
Used this app once and it worked, went to use it again straight after and it just stopped. The scanner to forever to focus and do the job. I'll be uninstalling
Does exactly what it says. Great for generating QR's, but the scanner is quite poor.
Good for creating codes, but not very good at reading them. Try Barcode Scanner. It's way better. Almost instant.
The app fails to read data from a saved qr image. This is the 1st time I rated an app 3 stars as I really want the problem to be solved. I rate apps only when it's a 5 star.
Great features, but slower than barcode scanner app when actually scanning :(
Great features, but slower than barcode scanner app when actually scanning :(
Doesn't scan Micro QR
Used to work much better, now somewhy not always recognizes qr made by iphone. Sometimes have to change angle, sometimes doesnt work at all, when redlaser gets it in a moment, even without centering screen. Plz fix!
I grew a beard by the time it finished scanning
Let's try
Only QR code. Cannot scan Barcode or 2D code.
Only QR code. Cannot scan Barcode or 2D code.
I was hesitant trying this out but its very responsive and super easy to use. First qr too. After using it...when I'm not using it I notice my phone battery consumption went up.
Tis a very apps but don't know why cannot focus? Do not see any issue in HTC sensation.
Excellent at creating your own QRs, but seems to be unable to scan even 1D codes if you don't hold a torch on the barcode & stay still for an age...
Developer seems more interested in adding more and more features than fixing bugs in existing ones.
The only time I have used this app it didn't work and seen as I only downloaded it for the purpose of scanning that one item I cant say its good but I also haven't tried it again so could have been a one off
I have tried this app since I need encoding. I generated a code, then ran it through a friends phone, using another app. No complaints.   Then my friend generated a code. Qr Droid was worthless. It kept messing with the focus, even though there was no need to. Only after I manually pictured the code externally, then came back and asked it to decode the saved pic, did it work.   An app which requires to use a side-use of itself through another app, making me work thrice, is plain wrong.   bottom: Needs fix.
I think it is great, by idea/ rating may be too low as I  did not have the info with app here when needed. So: Could be better explained where to cab for ' older '  non tech savvy ' tech explores. We really are using technology, will be huge target market! Thx
Had a strange problem with 5.1.  Worked very slowly if at all recognizing QR codes.  Uninstalled then reinstalled.  Still iffy.  Used Titanium Backup to go back to 5.0 and all is well again.  Samsung Galaxy S
Its a very nive app, but still I would rate it just 3. I have my reasons to do the same.  Pro: 1. Can upload the QR to its website qr.ai and has good sharing options. 2. Remembers history(others also do remember) 3. Can generate QR codes 4. Has some widgets e.g. clock with shortcuts to app features.  Con: 1. Not as good as scanning QR code as other apps(BARCODE SCANNER) 2. Sometimes doesn't even read its own generated QR code.
I cannot scan after i got latest version. Cant recognise
Bad in scanning from computer  HTC wildfire
It WAS working fine but there was an update this past weekend and now it doesn't scan most of the time
I can't update on my htc incredible s. .it says can't install on sd or phone memory
Sometimes it just won't scan but, when it does, it's ok.
This is great but its really slow and takes awaile to load!
It's slow...found i-nigma which is incredibly quick in it's aquiring the QR code, so this app is history for me
It reads Q.R codes easily, and links you right to the website. But when I made a Q.R code, I couldn't do anything with it.
It doesnt make a qr image of pocs. It just keeps going back to select image. Please fix.  Samsung fascinate
Very good And helpfull
What I don't get is why does it need personal info..I would give it 5 if it didn't other than that works fine
It does wok on none rooted device
The only thing I don't like is when I'm using my flashlight it goes on and off so I can never scan a qr at night it would be nice if the flashlight was able to stay on so I could position it to scan
Good to use...but not productive
hi    have coded an address and phone numbers like a business card and it scans OK but then doesnt save in contacts of phone. i have a galaxy 2s
Scanner
This app is pretty good. You would think that this stuff would be built into the Android OS, but this is worth having in your apps. It works well and the ability to share using an onscreen QR code is really cool.
Awesome QR reader. No issues with camera focus. And creating my own codes for contacts and other links is great. But I still need a seperate app to scan bar codes. . . Boo!
When the option 'Copy scan result to clipboard' is on QR Droid automatically runs system action. No matter that the default action is set to 'Ask me'.
Works when you want to use it but seems to want to be used all the time..... opens itself randomly! Annoying, uninstall.
As per title...app reported no camera detected but worked Before in honeycomb
Super addicting.
But few options to generate QR code. No fax, no separate name entry like title, name, surename and full name, and other vcard options (home, work phone). Nice app but weak generating vcard codes from contacts.
Works ok, but doesn't scan as quickly as Microsoft Tag. Uninstalling for now.
Good
Update: does not work with google maps....Great app Works smoothly
App is decent, but would like to have it automatically save all qr codes scanned in for future use, if don't save manually. I haven't seen the ads that pop in the free ver, but could do w/o that "bonus".
Just ok.
Slow, always wants to show me a better way to something, when I just really want it to open and scan.
Very goood
i like it
i like it
Stop hassling me to remove adverts or install other software, I choose this app because it was free...
I loved it when I was able to create codes. What happened??
love it
After several test on some old fashioned bar code at home does not scan as well as others.  In a store I don't want to be wasting time.  Sorry, not as foolproof as "Barcode Scanner". LG Optimus V .
I really love being deferred here to comment on my thoughts when I want to use my phone.
I don't really use it that much but I would recommend it if you see this kind of barcode a lot.
usefull
So far so good
Good to look .in to seekrets
Cry
Definitely worth trying out. Works as advertised with no fuss.
Not bad
Last major update gave it a better UI but lost some functionality. Can't even create your own QR codes anymore. *un-installing now*
So far I have only used it to scan QR codes which it does fine.
Scans from a lot of sources, very useful!
Not as useful as other people say but surly better than all similar apps. U have to try yourself
Works great for DROIDX. I made my own business card.
I just can't fathem why you are able to read my contact info,  idk you nor trust you.
This app is okay. But it doesn't always read what it should. And it's pretty slow a lot of times!
Works good D2
It's taking a long time to scan; when it finally does scan the code, it only captures half the link. The other scanners capture the full link, but they do not initiate the download for my apps I have created. This was working great a couple days ago :( Uninstalled and reinstalled, still not working right.
Has a lot of focusing issues on smaller codes.
Great concept. The search function to share contacts is pretty poor, though. Could definitely use tweaking.
Works great on some codes, somtimes it won't work, it just keeps trying to scan even in bright conditions. Nice for being free though.
The App is great but when you create a contact the address zip code and town are all put in the street field and not separated in the street, City and Zip code fields
Super functions
Doesn't work on all QRs
Excellant Samsung Mesmerize - No issues Works as it says - If for some reason the app will no longer scan saved images, clear the app cache
Pretty cool!
$$
I've been using this for months and it's better than barcode scanner :)
Hard time scanning qr codes
Hard time scanning qr codes
Ok app, all it needs is price comparisons and a good barcode reader and it will be complete!
Don't like the nag pop up to rste app but so far it works as it should. Loose that popup for an extra two stars fof me.
Don't find the QR codes that often. So for what it does when I find them its ok.
Great
Not bad does the job without to many tech issues
Unable to open QR images on my phone gallery. App does nothing ehen u click on de cv ode from saved images. SGS2
5*s if it could generate qr code for music and vedios.....cannot sent multiple contacts.-../.
Only used it once since getting it, but it worked fine. *not used since 4.0 update.
has everything regarding qr codes I could ask for :3
Works as it should plus extras.
What is the justification for sneaking access to comtacts into the update?
Worked great till I tried to change the color. Then it crashed repeatedly. Too bad cuz the previous version didn't do that.
Good
i dont see why everyone is complaining. its perfect.
serves purpose well but it doesn't have a friendly or instinctive user interface
Like the app. Not new interface. Reverted back - just matter of personal taste I guess
I just got the new app so im just geting use to it . The bad part is that I cant really delete my history . Its just really out there in the open .
Wouldn't work on my Droid X. Tried several different tags. It just keeps scanning over & over.
Web search icon not shown When scanning from camera
Yesterday I downloaded it and it wouldn't work. For some reason today it works perfectly

If your looking for an easy app to compare prices between stores in your area by scanning the barcode of the item with your camera I say use redlaser
Works ok, sometimes has trouble scanning qr codes. Has more features than some other qr apps.
Please add this. -Galaxy S
This app is simple to use. It also detects the qr code quickly without any trouble.
This app does not work... Tried several times. Test first before you release to Android Market!!
Sends to work ok. I'm new to qr but was able to create a code I added to my email signature and resume that takes people to my linked in resume
This is the absolute perfect QR code reader. The fact it allows one to create codes is a bonus. EVO3D
I wish doctors receptionist would use this... I could take a picture of my next appointment.... imports directly to my calendar with prescription info
I'll give the developer credit for a clear and easy to use interface but it would not scan a qr code from my brother and my phones...both have DROID X
I was using QR Driod and very happy with it. I just put the Froyo Android 2.2 upgrade on my phone and now QR Droid says it is incompatible with the phone. Wondering what is happening here? I'd love to change the rating to 5 stars because this app is worth that and more.

When it works it does what it should. I just find it hard to use.
scans fast, excellent feel... i don have to type aymore. damn u qr droid , u made homobsapiens lazy...
Not working on desire at all. Wont decode pics or work on cam.... Its on a taco bell cup that specifically says QR code...
This app is cool. I saw it on the news and I was just amazed how easy and cool it was so I downloaded it.
Fine but UI is overly decorated and fairly ugly. Would like a widget to initiate a scan.
Works well when I can get it to recognize a code. Most of the time blue dots just keep jumping all over the screen. Not sure if it's my camera or the app.
this app works great...(Zio)
Not crazy about these codes, wish there was just download links but this app works great.

This doesn't work as well as others at SCANNING a QR code. This app is presumably best at creating codes but I haven't tried that yet.

Downloaded it to take qr code pics when reading about apps... worked flowlessly, but used only once so far.
I guess I'm totally a dingbat cuz I'm not sure what its supposed to do.
My Samsung was left out b/c of OS, NOT ANYMORE! & WHAT FUN DECODING! Just genius! My phone is "smart" & Droid worthy once again! LOVE THIS! & funny to read reviews of some that didn't get it to "open". I started w/simple trade app & now have the entire world! This is best app ever!! Keep up the codes!
I can't find my vcard but I did just get this app. Have not played with it much yet!
Most of the codes scanned from magazines don't go to the page it directs to.
A little tough to learn but once I get it figured out I think it will be great
Not a bad app. Not all that useful unless all ur friends can scan QRs. Wish saved codes would go into the gallery tho
Works as advertised. Love that it can decifer QRs from almost anywhere. missing for me is ability to generate WiFi login. Otherwise complete

Can't scan a barcode image with a Moto Milestone. Android 2.2. My camera might be the cause though. I don't know.

After downloading and extensively testing all the available free barcode and QR code scanners, this one is definitely the best.
Really great functionality and complete app. I'm afraid there are some power drainage issues though. Tired of force closing, I'll need a substitute.

Its okey i mean when i want it to scan sumthinq it somtimes dose it...im not realy crzy about it....
This is ok. It has an annoying advertisment for dating service that sometimes gets in the way. I wish they had a delete ad button.
Amazingly well done. Wish there were more apps this well made on the market. Bang up work.
Great! But when scanning from camera, the flash button does not turn on the flash on my EVO 4g.
Those app. is really neat. I use this sometime. I had that since feb. 2011. HTC Evo Shift ^_~.
Idk if I'm doing this right but it doesn't seem to want to work... cause I've had it before and it worked just fine
Been using it for about a week now. It's a fun little app, and I haven't had any issues at all. HTC Evo 4G.
The App works well, but after last update it uses 94% of battery even when I'm not using it!?!?
The camera wouldn't take the picture after 30 sec. Of focusing. Sorry but it's a dud. Samsung intercept
Does a great job of scanning codes, but by God it chews up my battery. Permanently the second-highest juice user on battery info.
This is a great app! I had the Microsoft tag reader app first, and it doesn't even compare
I gave it 3 stars due to the flashlight doesn't work on the Evo 4g.
I just didn't scroll down far enough. Sorry!
Didn't really work for me.. rooted Cliq/no netfilter. I was able to connect a client but no internet access.. maybe nat probs. Also no wep.
Pretty good App, but I have come across a number of QR that could not be properly deciphered. Using HTC Desire.
Works great! The only thing that would be better is support for larger QR barcodes to hold more data. It will create them but has issues reading them.
Tastes great, less filling. Does everything it's supposed to do, and doesn't crash.
Liked it, but has been destroying my battery for some reason, so uninstalled until fixed, or I can find a problem on my phone. Nexus one.

I was going make the suggested $1.50 donation, after clicking on donate, the smallest resulting amount was $2.50. Bait and switch is wrong.
Got. To get ,information, is important and it's a new era, ALL IN A FLASH ;LEGAL OR PERSONAL PRIVATE IT'S REAL ....!!!!
Scans perfect for my cell Motorola photon
I'm not understanding all of the negative comments. Works just fine for me, for the most part. I have used this to read both print and online QR codes, and out has worked.
Only comment is, I feel when you scan a code it should jump straight to the web sight
Sweet app!
Good app  But doesn't always recognize the code. Otherwise, good!
It doesn't scan some codes, even after five minutes of changing the angle of the camera :-(
Does what it says.
Nice app.... ;-)
ؤبلورلولررايؤرتفقورت
ooooook
This app is so cool
Pls have an update for ICS
Nice app....
Works as it claims
Good but doesn't scan MS tags.
When it works it is fine, that just isn't very often.
No complaints
Ok la
One word. AWESoME
Works great love it!
Read and create qr codes... It's great!
Easy to use!
It's a great little app.
Fun so far
Great it works really well
Why permissions to read contacts and browser history?
Love the option for flashlight
Awesome app
I had tried the other apparently more popular app and had an epic fail. There was only blackness where the camera image would be. I don't own a Droid but this app works fine on my Motorola Atrix2. I am also glad that I can share the image and data that I've scanned thru several methods. I hope this holds up well.
@Heidi; You're hot you little sexpot. Mmmmmm.
Usually works well but could not focus on a code tonight. Kept trying to focus. Finally gave up trying to scan.
Excellent app
Since last update, doesn't read eadily qr codes...a shame...
Good app. Easy to use.
No probs after testing once. Hope its reliable.
Doesn't work with a crap.  Stupid auto focus never stops focusing so it can scan.  Waaaay too picky/sensitive. Not really useful/usable at all.
Easy to use,great app
It's pretty good i guess.
scanning image to server can be done for a short time. app is very cool. well I am happy with it.
I tried to scan a QR code on my computer screen and this worked within seconds unlike the other scanner app I downloaded before.
Does what it's supposed to do. Reading times are a bit painful though. I'd still say it's one of the best.
Download
Bit slow. But AD free is a thumbs up.
It will be focused then out of focus, then focused, then not.  I never scanned.  You are the weakest link, goodbye
This app is great! Now I can do things like get games from the internet onto my phone. This app works great but it is really kind of slow. The slowness is my only complaint
Great ap, does what it says on the tin, just dont think ill ever actually use it so i will be uninstalling. But happy with the ap
Plenty of options and well laid out
Doesn't seem to scan all codes.   About 1 out of 5. HTC Incredible.  Otherwise nice to create code.
If you need a QR code reader, download QR Droid for all of your QR-related needs.
Just got it. Seems to work great
This is really useful for making qr codes on the go (wish it would do barcodes as well, though).  I have a few issues. Firstly, like many other users, I find that the scanner is painfully slow sometimes, choosing to mess about with focusing instead of getting on with the job. Other scanners are much faster. Secondly, I have a QR code of my network ssid etc for people to scan. The scanner I usually use (by ZXING TEAM) offers to make the wireless connection, but QR Droid doesn't which rather defeats the object!  Lastly, and this goes for all apps that make and send contact details, why do I always have to separate first and last names manually? Grrr!   Overall, it's very good, but without a fix I can't recommend the scanner function.
Very useful, plus I've just discovered i can create my own codes!
Recently wont recognize XDA's QR....
Overall this is a really good application. The only problem I've had with it is sometimes it is difficult for it to read the QR Code or will be slow. But I still highly recommend this app!
A little bit slow when scan,
Easy scanning, easy QR code creator, qr clock widget is my fav with shortcuts to all qr functions.
Good. Easy to use. U can enter the code for a normal barcode but cant scan it.
This is a wonderful app. Does what it says and runs really smooth. Needs a different saving map for QR IMG. I can't find them in my photo maps.TIP FOR UPDATE.
This is a must have
Please get rid of blue writing in settings tab.  Its impossible to see. Would be magnificent if we could scan lottery ticket codes to check for winning tickets. Yes, my idea ! Thank You.
Thank you
Awesome features
I like it   Great
Justo g reat
Can be a little slow, but other than that really good
Just what I needed no more no less .
Why the update is 4 times in size the app? Solution: advertisers orders! Don't update!
Not everything comes up when scanned but still decent enough app for price comparisons and where to buy
Very useful app :)
Some items don't match the bar code.
Helpful
Picture, sms or a weblink . It can turn anything to a web code. It's friendly and robust. Helps me a lot.
Great program to develop codes
Sometimes it just won't scan but, when it does, it's ok.
works well.
Can't fault it so far.
Very usefull
Great app, but needs barcode scanner
The best app!!!
No real complaints, though I'd hope the next update reduces effect of having a shaky hand, :-D
Installs and works fine on HTC Incredible.  With Android 2.2, Webkit 3.1,  App. V3.9, V4.0.3.  Now using Android 2.3.4, Webkit 533.1, App. V4.0.3, V5.0.
amazing when used with the qr code extension on chrome
การสร้าง qr code หลากหลายดี แต่ ui ยังไม่ค่อยดี โดยร่วมดีครับ
Super do
This is the least stable app I've ever installed. It force closes EVERY TIME I try using it.

This app works pretty good.  Does quick scans and I even used it to scan a QR on a monitor screen.  One of the best QR readers out there.
I like it.
Great app
Works perfectly! Well done!
Download this one. For sure!
Good app
very help full to get some detail directly.
Does the job :-)
It is very interesting app. I am waiting for update. I hope there are more options
camera doesnt work on ICS/Asus Transformer. Otherwise wonderful app.
Can't complain, does what its meant to with ease.
Decodes everything quickly and with more options than other apps of similar type. Sidekick4G.

Great product.  easy to use and very responsive
Must install...
Use it all the time
Useful.
This app is pretty good. You would think that this stuff would be built into the Android OS, but this is worth having in your apps. It works well and the ability to share using an onscreen QR code is really cool.
Far out man cool app!!
Awesome QR reader. No issues with camera focus. And creating my own codes for contacts and other links is great. But I still need a seperate app to scan bar codes. . . Boo!
Accurate too
Works great but I hate the ads. Where's the paid version? I'd happily drop a few dollars on this.
Why does it need my personal information??!!!??!!
G
I'm loving it....
Its brilliant! What more needs to be said.
Works when you want to use it but seems to want to be used all the time..... opens itself randomly! Annoying, uninstall.
Was so-so on this, until I just found the settings for what the app does after scanning a code... making it SO much more useful!
Easy n fast! luv it.
Never had much luck with these type scanners but this 1 I found user friendly 4 sure.sure
Seems pretty good.
Works well easy to use.
Excellent app!
Neato
Very dissapointed. Froze my phone 4x in a row. Fix this bug, since it's not ICS friendly. (Samsung Galaxy)
Awesome
No problems with this app, YET...
Quick and easy......
Better than others...
Easy to use. Simply explained and useful, id defo recommend
This is nice app,you must use absoluate
If you include too much info in the QR code other devices many not be able to read it.
Great app, works really good.!
I love being able to scan QR codes when I'm out and about.  This works great, as long as the code you're scanning isn't too small.
It totally works!
Just dld n using on galaxy s2, opens webpages n recognises bar codes n book isbn. Nice app.
It's met and exceeded my expectations. Doubles my battery life.
Didn't no android phone's were capable of this
It does what it says on the tin. Good application!
good application
Works fine!
Was good for 1 time now it just zooms in and out
This app is relatively simple to use, however, it locks up foot periods when I can't get the camera scan to open on order to take a picture.
Okokokok
Best tool for we droid
Works faster than Google goggles.
Works well!!!
I've not used one of these before and now I see no need to try any other.

I have never tried any others but this one works great. Not a single problem.
Works great, not a perfect score because they made something so simple actually look complicated: ui could be better
Good app
Scans qr code but when you try to open the url, it mmediately closes the browser making scanning the code useless
love it
Well, the apparently that came with the phone sucked!  I just wanted to do a couple clicks and scan...  This apparently did that and much more!  I wish the app had options for opening such as:  App open with camera ready to scan a code...  If you mostly scan codes then just open the app then click... done.

This app suggested I leave a comment after about a month of use. Works as advertised.
Haven't used it a whole lot yet really don't know what all can be done with this but so far so good
I love it! Wish we could remove ads for free though.
Great application.
Good
Good.
Does what it says and it works fine so far on Samsung galaxy s2.would 5star but have not had it long.
QRDroid is easy to use and self explanatory.   Great app for free.  Keep up the good work!!
Good ..app qr
I downloaded this app for school purposes and it works great! The only problem for me is creating a code. It seems to me you have to take an original one and do your own edits to it. It's quite fun to play around with.
App is decent, but would like to have it automatically save all qr codes scanned in for future use, if don't save manually. I haven't seen the ads that pop in the free ver, but could do w/o that "bonus".
i originally gave this ap a 1 star review however recieved response from the creato swiftly giving me a full run down of what was happening and how to fix it up, turns out i was missinterperating what i was being told in app.  great at what it does, a little bit (1 star) knocked off for the display not being optimised for tablets and for the warnings being placed at the bottom of the desciption
Easy to use & works great!
An app that does what it says!  No more no less.  Thank you
Just ok.
Works great
Does the job. Nice
Does the job. Nice
the time to scan is about what should be expected, but takes several scans to get the hang of  what distance to use. RECOMMEND HIGHLY
Perfect app. Hany and easy to use
Excellent application easy to use.
Very useful
Bad for old upc codes
Next Generation Barcode simplified!
and that's good enough for me
Very useful app. Go get one
Quick and easy way to scan both barcodes and QR codes.
Good stuff
Have used a few other QR readers. Like this one the best. Has more features than the others.
Always appreciate something new
Stable

I have the Droid Pro and it works everytime. Not a glitch! Thanks!
Good
Very good
This is easy to run others you have spend time focusing
Works awesome. Fascinate samsung 4G
Nice
Happy with this app.
Salute
Just a bit clearer on instructions and functionality and it would be perfect as it's not as intuitive as the developers might think!
I created an app for my company n it's very innovative!
Very usefull.
Accesses your browsing history and contacts!  Im not exposing family and friends to their marketing.  Uninstalling this otherwise good app.
quite good really, does what it should.
Perfect!
What do you want more?
could be easier to use but is very powerful
Good QR code system
Very helpful easy to use.
Like usability
Very good way of making QR bitmaps.
Does brilliantly what it says. Simple n easy
Absolutely wonderful! Does everything it should and efficiently!
Works extremely well. Took the author's advice about distance, and I have never had a problem. lg revo gingerVolt
Nice one...
Good user interface for beginners and plenty of features for more experienced users.
Read and create QR Codes works well! Code your world. GrowDojo
Works great. Be careful what you scan. Some scans are trojans.
Works well, but it could be a bit faster with a bit cleaner UI.
Very sensitive and fast. Easy to use.
Much better than others on galaxy SII i would give it 5 stars if it could scan regular bar code also
Worth trying
Works well
I wonder if it works...I give it a 1 only because there's no 0
It works great and quickly
I LOVE to scan QR codes so I needed an app that works as hard as I do!!!! Jackpot with QR DROID!!!
A QR code reader that has all the features I look for. Works great on a LG Revolution. Am still looking for a generator/decoder that allows tracking.
It's a good app, even though I don't use it very often and sometimes it can't read the code, say if the colours don't have enough contrast
Pokoke siiip laah...
Works without problems on my d3.
It's easy to use and very useful, especially for those who just need a simple app.
Does what it is supposed to.  Like the fact that I can create a QR Code out of any of my contacts, including mine.  Easiest way to share my details.
This is a good app
Very useful app for todays world. I use it with my mail and to quickly search all the time. Worth your time.
Worried about malicious QR codes that are becoming a problem. QR Droid gives you the option to be asked about sending personal information before you're directed to a site which is good. We'll see how well it works.
Super easy to install and use
Very helpful
But it disappears from my apps.
Cannot read colored qr code, that I have found in the GEICO magazine. I wander who is wrong, the app or the geico`s code is not standard...
... which seems to become rarer and rarer...
Easy to use. Recommend it.
The DROID QR worked better than Microsoft reader.  I like it!
Cool app.. One stop solution for decoding and generation. So far no issues.
Good.
Does what its supposed to and that works for me!
Easy install. Love the "box" guide on screen to size over QR. A bit tetchy till it "gets" the code.
Does what it says, easy to use qr scanner. Did not rate 5 because I question why it needs so many permissions. Seems like a privacy problem.
After a brief learning curve, I prefer their slightly different approach to that of other QR apps.
Easy way to share everything in QR Codes with this app
Very fast app, very convenient
Very handy. Works every time in every way.
Great Application....just what i needee!!!!!
The upgrade is very much like a whole new application with in itself.  The scanner is extremely accurate in finding its result's on the internet, etc.
Works good... But i dont like pop ups asking for rating
Does what it says
Not too fancy
Best code app I've downloaded!
Essential tool...
Good
Good and convenient application.
I keep this handy for my electronic business card, really everything, for my agency! Very useful!
Nice
It allows you to create your own tags unlike some of the other apps.
Good QR App. Easy to use. Good solid app that works with my OG Droid.
Easy to use, although that might want to consider a light version that only scans, thank for all the work.
Scans from a lot of sources, very useful!
I tried 4 free and paid ones and this is simply the Best!  Does it all!  Try it!  Should be on all smart phones!
Works great cant beat it.
Very useful app
Works very, very well. No drama.
Works great for DROIDX. I made my own business card.
Does exactly what it says it does .
I just can't fathem why you are able to read my contact info,  idk you nor trust you.
Great app!
Very good.
Works great on droid 2. Sometimes it takes a little while, but over all, very nice
Works perfectly.
The majority of the time(90%+) there are no issues scanning the codes with my HTC Desire. On occasion the software can't seen to decode the qr code.
No comment
Its a great app i m loving it!!!!
Nice way to share information.
Works well, easy to create codes
Downloaded this app a couple of days ago, tested it one a magazine that I had and it has no problem with it. Galaxy S2
Wonder what's in those mysterious bar codes of various types? Reads a bunch of 1D & 2D bar code formats besides QR. Most of the apps out there don't.
Until bow every qr code was read properly
App is great. But I hate ads
Seems to be a good solid app that does what it claims.
It is an easy to use scanner that delivers every time. Highly recommended
Used this app for about half a year without a single issue.
A real good app, its great that you can make them too
I'm happy with the functionality and ease of use.
This app seems to have more features than 'Barcode Scanner' but I don't find it to be as fast and convenient. So I'm sticking to Barcode Scanner for regular use, and keep this for special purposes.
The ability to create a shortcut on my home screen is awesome and saves me having to hunt down the right option in the application.
Works great
And easy to use!
Great app. Easy to use.
Great
Freezes me up on occasion but otherwise decent
Works great
Works great.
Works well. Easy to use.
Works well. Easy to use.
good
This is a great thing to have nowadays
Awesome app, user friendly and quick on my Droid- Nice!
It reads most codes pretty fast. Some it takes a minute, but I've never had any issues with it.
Works fine for most of the time! But with some bar codes it take longer time to read!
I like that all you need is one app to scan all QR codes, & create your own for business or whatever. Works on my android phone!
It's pretty cool
I have used this in stores, museums, and in looking at colleges for my daughter. It is great.  Sometimes a focusing issue, however.
Really useful app as many shops have the scan now but it very difficult to save the shop scans to the app should have a file on the app for it
Works good so far.
takes very less time to gather the info from the QR code.but the link takes longer to load in the browser though this may not be the app issue
Makes a good drop in replacement for Barcode Scanner, tons more features, shame about being bugged to leave comments.
Good app motorola atrix
Good app motorola atrix
Once you start the app just point the camera at the QR code and it detects it automatically. No guesswork
Does what it is supposed to do.
Nice work!
It works great EXCEPT everyday for the past two weeks it has reported that there is an update. I keep clicking update & then it says it is updated
Scans QR's using the camera and can scan saved QR's from messages or saved on my SD. Works perfectly on Desire HD, awesome!
Perfect, does what it says. Nice and fast, and very convenient. -HTC Thunderbolt
Easy to use. Works great on HTC incredible.
It works
Works well without taking up too much memory. Once read, the code makes available content quickly. Only down side is code has to be read perpendicular
Cool
After many searches n experiments.. found this to be the best-all-in-one application.. kudos
Ok
It lags during downloads but other than that.. It's a world shifter ^^
Does exactly what it should

It's kinda cool to use this but I'm not sure that it's so much better than just going to the website.

Best I've found! And I'm not kidding, I'm picky...and like all-in-one.
Simple, to the point. A must have.
Works great so far
Only QR scanner that has ever worked for me. Tried goggles and a few others. This is the one. ;) great work. Evo 4g and 2.3.4
Yet to scan a code.
You know what ppl? Simple works the best!!
Good app. Does what it's supposed to.
Works alright on a droid x
It didn't crash my phone.
Works as advertised. Phone position during scan a little tricky
I like this a lot..
Does the job and a nice little QR 'tool' as well!
Easy to use and has saved me loads time cos I scan a barcode and go back to it when I need to/remember! Definitely an app to have
It works.
This ap is helpful but sometimes the QR's don't always link up right.
This seems to be the *most* complete QR application. BUT STILL does not have the ability to use it as an input method. I know I am not the only one that wants this function. How come no developer can deliver? And no, I don't want a keyboard that has a scan function. I want a scanner that I can pull up in text box by long pressing and choosing it in "input methods". Is that too much to ask? 5 Stars once you get this feature. 6 Stars if I could. In fact, I'd pay $2.99 for this feature.
Very handy at times does what its supposed to do.
Handles all you code scanning needs. I especially like using it to scan items at the store to compare prices online
works good and it's very useful
Good sheeiitt
Easy to use.
It works when I go to use it . Interface is pretty straight forward .
I really like this app. It reads most things and gives me info right away. I have an EVO by HTC.
No troubles. Haven't had any problems reading codes off of screens, or other objects.
You could have an option to automatically populate fields with your contact information. Its a pain to have to always enter your info.
Best way to keep info hidden
I would rate higher if map also had sat view
I would rate higher if map also had sat view
Really great for writing QR codes. Very simple!
The best qr code reader
A program that does what its supposed to! Great!
Like it
This is definitely better than the barcode app I installed earlier. Its faster and more user friendly
used this app for installing the dropbox application QR code from net....its super quick n easy.....Rocking...
Love it!
Its so easy to use and saves everything in the history for you to use later...
Being able to generate codes is a bonus. Having added content that educate users about what QR codes are and how they work is very interesting.
Have not had a problem with this app!
Do not use often but when I do it does its job!
Great app... Works perfect
Verry user friendly! :) this us totally the way of the furure!!!! Well done android ;)
only one that i found that can read QRs straight from SD using a explorer manager app. Great job!
Always wanted a reader cause I seen so many codes. Now I got it and there r no codes around.... still love iit though. Sharring discreet info with fam
Works
Works great on EVO 4G
The only thing I have a problem with is that it seems to take awhile for it to scan from camera but other than that its good
Highly recommended app! No issues to-date.
QR Driod's UI is much cleaner and more intuitive than Quickmark; ESPECIALLY like the ability to easily make a shortcut icon of whatever you create
What da hell is this?
Works perfect and very easy to understand
This app dies lots of great things with QR codes. Reads the well and is one of the best at generating them.
Excellent addition to the DROID Arsenal
Works really well on Dell Streak (2.2.2). On line QR code generator is useful too.
Good app
Good app
App works with my Lg Apex
Well it scans all codes but the app is useless because it only tells the code read which does not yield any useful search results.
Reads tags very quickly!
Easy to use. No complaints.
Works as it should plus extras.
Works as it should plus extras.
Good but doesn't always tell you if you encounterrd an error or not Sometimes when you scan it didn't report why you didn't get the results.
Works well
I don't think it's ever been unable to read a qr.
Very good app
Works great .Period!
As a business person I find this application very useful and it does what it supposed to do. A dedicated button to print out the image is needed
Love it
It us really cool to be able to scan something and it take you to a website, or to send notes, etc
Great app but wont let me see contacts with just names and email. If they have phone number then they show up. But yes great app, love the features
Now friends can scan my contact easily.

This app is a solid. It doeswhat it claims and makes fairly straight forward to use. You do have to drill down into the settings to speed it up.
It works very well
Does what it says and has a fair and pretty intuitive interface. Recognition is very good IMO
If they would have kept the qr code generator I would have given it a 5 star rating
Does everything as advertised, pretty tight -Incredible + Really clean UI! :)

Not bad. I like it
Working great for me.

Great and easy app to use! Absolutely no problems getting this to scan so far.
It could be 5 from me, but it's slow sometimes, and it keeps saying I have an available update when I don't, requiring a reinstall.
Excellent!
Excellent!
Easy to use no errors does what its supposed to without starting up all the time
More featured than most but can be hard to read the codes sometimes
Can not install update, keep getting error that it can not install on sd card but app is on the phone
It says there is an update available but i dont see a place to click so i can update it? It just has OPEN or UNINSTALL options?

Wow this is the most amazing QR reader in android hands down! Love the new UI! Thanks!

Took me awhile to get the camera function down (user error) solid app. Droid 2 Global
Works ok, sometimes has trouble scanning qr codes. Has more features than some other qr apps.
Very slick, well executed app. Don't see why it needs contact access, but still great.
its awesome! its so cool when it decode the things and tells you what website they are.

Very good QR scanner. Has been able to scan arcades in low light that other apps couldn't. You can manually turn on theft light when scanning.
This app is simple to use. It also detects the qr code quickly without any trouble.

Fast, efficient, easy to generate and decode in less than a minute. Takes you right to the website, address or info source!
If you need an app that can handle QR codes you could do a lot worse than this. A good app with a lot of source options.

Creating and scanning works flawlessly, allows shortcuts to specific functions for the home screen which I think is really useful. Scan time isn't always consistently short but it always does the job. Running on galaxy S2.

Very, very cool technology...dig it. Looking forward to using this app to it's full capacity, and intention.
Good for codes but pops up every time you hold search button very annoying (wildfire)
Love it works even when you least expect it to ie. My hospital bracelets it astonished me
Has plenty of good features..
Best generator I have used yet... Not the best scanner... But still gr8.... Won't scan from a saved photo on my phone... Files 2 large....

Works good. Just h aad hard time getting the phone to focus. Fixed it by making sure all the other things the camera saw were the same distance.

It sometimes has trouble focusing on close-up codes but otherwise it's a fantastic tool! It even reads UPC codes!
Works well, although tried to scan my hospital tag and it simply came up with loads of nonsense numbers and letters, akin to a programming language?
When it works it does what it should. I just find it hard to use.

Had to hold my phone at a funny angle. keeps trying to focus. But it is working fine now.
Its actually really fun to use, would have been better if the adverts hadn't of gotten in the way a few times.
Main drawback is searching by product barcode (eg. groceries) usually brings up failed results.
It is a very good app for some reson. Even fun it takes 2sec to make a 2d barcode and share it

Definitely met my expectation. Works fine! Reads and creates QR codes fast and keeps it simple. You can even send a picture to it from your gallery...
Works well when I can get it to recognize a code. Most of the time blue dots just keep jumping all over the screen. Not sure if it's my camera or the app.
I paid for the ad remove code but never received it. Now in dispute with pay pal to get my money back... waste of time what a rip off... Don't Pay for a code.

Does what it's supposed to do: scan the barcode thingy and take you to the related website.
this app works great...(Zio)
Works well, the only problem is make sure the program is not running in the background when you are doing other things or your battery is dead.(Aria)
I've only use this app for a couple of days now, and so far I love it.

I downloaded this because I wanted a QR reader, but this turned out to be significantly more. Reads and generates all forms of QR. Excellent.
It works and I will be using it to make my very own. Wait to get my site showing it!
This and ShopSavvy are the only scanner apps I found that support my flash which makes scanning much easier.
Tried scanning QR codes tons of times but each time it would just keep trying to get it into focus
I agree a with previous comment that the scanning process isn't very obvious, but this is by far the best qr scanner that I have yet found.
Havent had any problems. I guess its my stupidity but it took me a long time to figure out how to scan...but otherwise no problems

All I get is info without ability to "scan" anything. Too bad I can't rate it a ZERO. using droid X
My Samsung was left out b/c of OS, NOT ANYMORE! & WHAT FUN DECODING! Just genius! My phone is "smart" & Droid worthy once again! LOVE THIS! & funny to read reviews of some that didn't get it to "open". I started w/simple trade app & now have the entire world! This is best app ever!! Keep up the codes!

Can't scan a barcode image with a Moto Milestone. Android 2.2. My camera might be the cause though. I don't know.

This app is really good! It allows you to view videos and info via the QR (the QR looks a bit like a barcode).
Works like a charm! Just snap a photo of the barcode and "POOF" it will show you the URL or translated barcode number.

Very nice program! Conveniently create your own QR Code for your friends to scan instead of type in!
Works well! Easy installation and use, just needs a little help reading in some cases...remember to use the light option if you have it!

Does what it is supposed to do. Looked at my battery use out of curiosity, one scan was responsible for 33% of my battery use.
Easy to use and can scan from most surfaces without problem. Definitely a good user friendly experience!

Does everything I want with ease.
Got everything i need!
Great app, can't fault it!!
Won't. Scan
No issues at all.
Working great on my HTC Sensation!
Great App. It would be nice if it could generate a complete vcard like the qr code generator web site with address, postal code, organization, etc.
One of the best QR app out there. Full of functionality and everything is easily accessible.
I uninstalled this and went for QR BARCODE SCANNER cos this one wouldn't read a barcode and the other one would
This app is great. Works perfectly n quick to scan. Uninstalled one other app n installed this one. Saved no problem so far. Provides list of customizable options. Great work
I love that it is ad free!!! Awesome functionality!! Scans quick. Problems of previous version have been addressed.
Best reader yet. Thanks!
Does what I need it to
No complaints.  Always works. You've got to have this App.
Good
Does what it says. Better than any I've tried. Amazon price check is good too.

Use extensively for a not-for-profit museum so people can get more information about displays and exhibits.  Thanks
Iv been using this for a while, it works well for me, c summat on my laptop dat i want on fone jst qr scan it n bingo got it
Simply, I love this app and use it all the time.
I use this all the time. Great app!  Easy to use!
一scan就scan到。
Awesome
Works well, but doesn't respect default app selection.
Does what I've wanted it to
No negatives thus far. Love it!
Great tool I've ever used! So far no problems!
I don't think so... It's fully functional imo. Runs great uploads, r immediate. No problems or complaints here,  Iuse the crap out of  nit so should every one else..
Standard.
Exvellent         Km.
I only just started using this app recently,yes I know I'm late. Turns out though that it's incredibly easy and anyone can use it.

Rooted Razr
Should be able to retrieve saved qr codes from within app.
Its really a amazing application. Advanced technology in our finger tip.
It is a good app if u are looking for houses
Like a warrior said..ip man
Great app!
Great app!
ooooook
Love it and no ad's
Works great and has very good supporting features. I tried 3 others before but this one is for me the best I found. Two thumbs up!
Good better than some others.
Evo. Like it! It can take a bit to scan but not enough to bother me one bit
Even though it "can" take a few seconds to "lock in", It's terrific!  The only thing I would update is for the app NOT to "remember" the last scan as soon as the app opens. It's a little bit of a pain to have to back out of the app 1 or 2 times to get it to default to the scanning function, but it's still VERY worth 5 stars!
Nice app....
Works as expected.
Superb
The best, by far.
Nice one!
Does what its supposed to. Only problem is it has to either be good lighting or have a flash.
Works well
Works well
Jhakas
Works just as advertised! Keep up the great work!
I love this app. It has everything you need to use QR codes. Easy to create, decode, store and share your codes.
Great job scanning squares
I was writing an article on how to create QR codes for your resume and this program does it best out of 7 tools I tried.
great app that convenient for me to get information i need about the product i want to buy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Does what it says with ease and simplicity. Scans bar codes as well as QR codes and even allows you to make your own QR codes. No matter what anyone says about other QR scanners or just scanners in general, this one is the best hands-down! I only have one complaint and that is that I don't like the UI but that is neither here nor there in terms of this app's service.
Allows you to scan codes but also create and encode links and codes.
Great
Great
Ilove it it's soon easy-to-use and it's cool
Works very well and a very useful tool.
Simple interface, and the only barcode app you need! Versatile, quick scanning, and allows users to create a large variety of codes on the fly.
Excellent app. Works ok.
It works great,especially helpful at estate sales, to identity paintings, music,etc.It doesn't authenticate paintings,what do ya want from a free app?
Best app for qr
Love how it quickly reads codes... none compares. Great job!
Very good okay
Greatest person to have ever lived!
I noticed when i went to share a pic from my gallery,there was all the normal options such as share via Bluetooth or facebook. Then i saw a huge section of chinese symbols! Like maybe 30 secs worth of scrolling. I bet u can guess which app was the culprit. Uninstalled
Love it
Easy to use!
Cool

The best qr app as by far. .... I like it

Auto focus is your phones problem. Back up and your camera will focus, everyone has bad macro.
This app was great in the first place but with it being ad free makes it even better!
Thank you Helena

@Heidi; You're hot you little sexpot. Mmmmmm.
Best QR app I have used... Keep it up

An excellent app! I have tried many, and this is by far the best for my needs. It also links with other apps that I use. Very handy to create a QR code with my business card details too.

Did its job perfectly. Scanned my airheads ticket and now I might win a chance to meet Big Time Rush :) lol
Developers I just wanted to say great work, decoding of qr codes is superb option
Does exactly what it says.
Excellent scan times. Good functions like creating your own qr codes.
does exactly what it says
Works well on HTC one v so far good
I have used 20+ qr apps and qr droid is the best, most functional app available.
It's doing gr8 what it should do
I like that I can make my own QR codes.
Works great with Droid X2. Thanks
Works great
This app works very well on my phone. I use it a lot & I'm really pleased with it.
Excellent app would not be without it a must have for every mobile user
Works excellent, creating your own qr codes is really easy to do.
This is an excellent app. There are plenty of options to explore. I am  not at all dissapointed in any way with QR Droid & the absolute lack of advertisements is just another bonus. karmashadow.
This truly deserves two thumbs up!!
Since last update, doesn't read eadily qr codes...a shame...
Does exactly what it says on the tin (play store). Thanks
love it
Just works
La integración es buenísima y rápida :)

The app that i really need ... Free and no ads
It's sad that this seems to have stopped working.  I  can barely get It to scan a QR code.  Mobitag and the US post office app work faster.  I'll keep It on my phone to generate QR codes only as that is all It's good for now

Brilliant I downloaded other apps for this but I cud never make a qr code on them. Well done
Simple
Nice interface. Very slow and finicky scanning. Other scanners are quite a bit better.
I love this app
Extremely easy to use! Very versatile.
Great
Worth getting.  This app has taught me that QR codes are some things we should all be aware of for any marketing and networking.  Great work!

Easy to learn
The clock widgets are cool and gave me an excuse to uninstall seperate ones, but could they get some options like 24 hour time?
Excellent app, very useful and handy. Every update adds new functionalities making it one of, if not The, most complete software there is for creating, editing and customizing Qr codes.
Exellent
Its a must have apps in your mobile very usefull
Good
Great apps
I wish had this when I was in. School so I can secret code to my class
Super free app. I love it.
App

This is where its at.
The flexibility is superb. Being able to just bring up a previously created QR code and share it INSTANTLY with another smartphone user saves time.  I'd give it one more star if I could.
After 5 minutes of holding my phone trying to get this app to scan a Q code it was still trying to focus. I exited and immediatly uninstalled
Great and simple!
Good for generating QR codes on your phone, but the scanner NEVER works.
Great
Just ad support made look a but UNCOMFORTABLE on small screen, rest is cool
Just ad support made look a but UNCOMFORTABLE on small screen, rest is cool
Grt apo
Thats all i can say
Very comprehensive we app.  Use it nearly every day.  Very well worth installing
Does what its needs to do no.fuss
Great app .  Found it very useful
Useless app. Takes over a  minute to scan if it does work but usually just refuses to recognize any codes.
If you have a focus problem just pull back and go in again. Not really that slow considering what is powering it. SGT 10.1
I love this app! Im having the QR Code it generated with my info printed on the hard business cards that all the oldtimers insist on having.
Does what it's supposed to do. Reading times are a bit painful though. I'd still say it's one of the best.
Never stops trying to focus. Unable to use it.
Powerful. Flexible.

This is not slow app, your smartphone is slow. Great app!

Few crashes and it allows me create qr codes as well. I only wish you could scan uploaded images.
Love this app.
Check

Hi its great
Great functionality, thanks.
This app is great! Now I can do things like get games from the internet onto my phone. This app works great but it is really kind of slow. The slowness is my only complaint
Just as advertised. Not bad at :)
Best app
Really helps and works perfectly fine, good app to just have on your phone
Truly 5 star
Scanning
I have tried almost all of qr apps in google play on my old Galaxy S. This one runs smoothly, offers many features such as creating QR codes. It's free and there's no annoying ad. Million thanks to creators.
I couldn't stop myself from giving this 5 stars.Never really cared to rate the apps.but this really impressed me!!!!
Added bonus of being able top create.
El mejor scanner de codigos que he tenido.

This is the perfect accessory to have when scanning those qr codes. Works like a charm. It also has a variety of ways to keep the application handy.
Can't do without my QRdroid. This is my second install since I  upgraded to a new HTC. Brilliant app thanks guys!
This is by far the best QR reader i found so far.
I love this app its awesome.
Excellent. I downloaded this hoping it had an option to use the LED, and it did.
This app has been helpful
This is amazing!!!!!
Pretty cool, i love it great 1'd it

Just great.
Nice app

Recently wont recognize XDA's QR....

This is the best QR reader/writer on the android store. All of the different QR exports are amazing.
I haven't actually scanned anythin yet but making my contact into a qr 4 ma m8s 2 scan n get ma details is amazing! Xx
Im so glad I have it
I wanted it for a few things and it did what it said it would.
Make your live easier  Loool
The best QR scanner out there, there is nothing this application can't do.
For what it's designed to do.
Fantastic works great just like I read.
Next  Super app I liked a lot
Great app...works fine Droid Bionic
Doesn't read the barcodes
Good.
I love this app!!!!!!!
Worked fine until last update. Now won't scan a thing... :-(
Love this app
Es muy Buenos y pinto
If you don't know how to use QR Droid, you can read in-app help or write to info@droid.la. Most common problem is not leaving enough distance between the device and the code, so the camera can focus. Some devices need as much as 3ft / 1m.
Works great
Works 100%
Works 100%
Does exactly what it was designed for.

This app has come in handy thanks for making it and free
Cool!!!!
Can't recommend enough, will produce, scan and read all in one app. Only one thing would make it better, the option to create multi colour codes.
X-LENT APP!!!!!!!!!!
Liking it!
Exellent
Trying to figure out how to make my phone number or email address appear as encrypted  qr code when sharing a msg as qr code.
Really nice app!  The app has a little issue. It can't recognise URLs with non-standard LTDs in QRCode like "domain.lan". I miss that feature a lot! If you feel like me please ask for that and the devs would consider to add that feature.
good
Very simple but oh so very useful!
i've used many...i personally like this one
Fez made me get this app, I love Fez!!
Thnx for this great app.
(sp?) ndb
i like this app so much :x
Thanks 4 making the app ad-free for all ur loyal users.
Baba Booey
This app is genius! It can easily create and read QR code which contains encrypted text.   It's a handy way to keep sensitive info in convenient places and have it accessible via QR Droid.   A couple of weak aspects:   There no mention of the quality of encryption.   The encryption process is a leeetle scruffy. The generated title for the encrypted QR code is the begining of the pre-encrypted text. There should be an option to set the passkey for an encryption session (rather than keep reentering it)
Very useful app :)
Perfect app
Great app!!

This app came in very handy when we recently bought a new tv. The guy at Best Buy looked a little uncomfortable but being able to get immediate reviews helped us makes a better purchase! Thank you, thank you!
I like to look @ the galaxy it's good to have.
All in one package, to read and create. Intuitive and logical, start up fast.

Do not understand why this app needs to read my contacts and browser history ...  Removed ... I'll use another app

Not like any other QR app I've downloaded. THIS ONE ACTUALLY WORKS!

Hi I recently changed roles in my company to one that involves the use of QR Codes, so I had to give myself a crash course. Over the last few days I've discovered that QR Droid is by far the most reliable app for reading and producing the codes - sometimes I haven't even had time to steady my 'phone and its already done the job! Excellent product!
Love this app! Super easy to use, both in scanning and creating qr codes :)
Love it!
Works perfect..... I love it!!
Works perfect..... I love it!!
Fast, easy to use, allows for many different customizations. Of course, there are 2 versions - paid & free. But this app has something different.  There are several ways to obtain the ad-free version, including payment options, sending out a link, etc.  I thought they had some good ideas. I will be keeping this app - what more do you have to know with 10 million + downloads

People bitching about privacy issues are wrong. Read the notes. IT DOES NOT TAKE ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION AT ALL!!!!!
This is the best app I use it for everything.
Very nice-looking and useful app. Not sure if it can read 1D barcodes as well, but that's not very important. Overall excellent app.

Matthew, you can remove Ads by making a small donation or by referring. Open QR Droid, touch More, scroll down and select 'Remove Ads' or 'Refer'
I love that it can turn different things into QR codes.
Great
I needed a app that made perfect QR code. Even better this allows u to customize the color and add logo and a label. Awesome app.
Although google goggles does the job for scanning pictures, got nothing similar as far as creating qr codes!
Allows me to obtain more info that I use everyday.
Apps!!! Love the update...keep it up and keep it free...
simply awesome...
This apps ok for QRs but not for regular bar codes
This application is good.
It's such a simple application but amazingly detailed to use. It will not let u down. Customer service is top notch also.  Strongly recommended to people who use the QR codes on a daily basis.
Good
The latest update has made the UI awesome!!
I enjoy this app that I don't have words to say
That's the best QR Reader available. Thanks
Easy to use, excellent app :)
Does exactly what it's supposed to, unlike some! Does it fast, easily and well!
Easy, well done: it works without any surprises.

The new layout simply does away with the home screen! Instead, all the main functions are integrated into the scan screen with no loss of functionally! I like this design much better. Well done.
Works well easy to use.
New update and ui is great. went to referral and pressed the claim prize once installed and it removed the ads without any effort! :)
does exactly what it says it would, good integration with contact list
Great app.stop far the adds don't bother me enough to buy the upgrade
Love it works

This best qr scanner I know of.. it allows you to use a flash in those not so well lighted area's...
Scans QR codes like it says. You can even download codes to your phone and scan them or create your codes. Those features make this app outstanding. More than just a simple scanner!
I love this app, its by far one of the best scanners I've used, i love the feature where i can make my own scans of almost anything. Thank you Droid LA:-)
Works fantastic on my Xperia arc s, a really useful app to have!
Love this QR app above all others due to its simplicity and features!
This game is so addictive! Force closes sometimes, but great other than that
I was looking for one that can handle me cards and SMS codes
I give it a 5 star it doing what it said.

Good tool.
Very dissapointed. Froze my phone 4x in a row. Fix this bug, since it's not ICS friendly. (Samsung Galaxy)
Great program. It is so capable and feature packed. The qr code on my webpage was created in this program. My only complaint is the settings menu is impossible to read in daylight or a bright room. Light blue on white has little contrast.

Cool app. That it be all
Rocks

Great app!!!
Fast and flexible. Couldnt ask for more.
This app is getting more annoying, the longer I have it.....used to work perfectly, now works about 40% of the time. Will take 1 pic, then lock up, or take all 3, but not save. Also, its lame that you have to edit the pic RIGHT THEN, if you save and then go back, you can use the HDR editing. Needs fixing.
No problems with this app, YET...
Many features!
Better than others...
i hope this fad dies soon.
Is amazing
No unnecessary stuff, just the ones that are useful.
This is nice app,you must use absoluate

It a the best app to scan code
It's a very good app..
Works great for all needs and requirements. Can't fault it. Well done and thanks.
Super app.
Alot faster and scans at a glance. Also does not make any annoying noises when scanning. Yet to try the creation section.
Great app
QR Droid has recognized every single qr which I've thrown at it... :-)
I scan a code and it force closes
:-)
Has worked easily on every QR code I've tried. No flaws so far.
nice, but useful
Must have!!
The ultimate app when it comes to Bar Codes n QR Codes.. It can even create a QR Code of absolutely anything! It can do anything.. Must have app.. :-)
Great
I use this for quick transfer of info from my phone to almost any other device. No bluetooth or any other configuration required.
Been using it since I downloaded it and love it.
works fine and handy, but quite large
Full featured and free. Consistent and useful updates. To the developers, nice work.
Cool way to share dirty thoughts.
Love it!
Love it.  Simple way to share just about anything.  I have multiple devices in multiple places and I'm always mobile so finding this app was a miracle for me.  Exactly what I've been looking for as far as sharing data and having access to it no matter where I am.
Works all the time, great work time.
Does what it says and does it well

Worked awesome on Atrix !
It is working perfectly :-)
Simply best QR code scanner, maker. . . One word, excellent.
I used this application out-of-the-box. Nothing broke and it did not require any setting.
This app provides clear information about the contents of a QR code. It won't auto-fetch the URL, or auto-open some other app without first showing the raw data/URL. Conversion to/from a QR code and a history are nice features. Detection of QR codes is pretty good. I have not tried the app on non-QR image codes.
Great app..it has it all
Quite simply a brilliant ap!
Very good ใช้ดีมากๆ

Useful!
i originally gave this ap a 1 star review however recieved response from the creato swiftly giving me a full run down of what was happening and how to fix it up, turns out i was missinterperating what i was being told in app.  great at what it does, a little bit (1 star) knocked off for the display not being optimised for tablets and for the warnings being placed at the bottom of the desciption
Luv this technology thinking of getting a tshirt made using a code
Excellent
Works well, very useful.
Easy to use, works well
Very handy to have when you need it.  It also has the extra functions I needed.
Works well on Dell streak.  Easy to use

Sweet as! Must have app... works great on desire
Use it every day, thanks
Supremely useful. Not much else to say. Recognizes where Google Goggles can't.
@frank, if you want to generate a qr code for one of your contacts, then GUESS WHAT? It'll need permission to access them!
I just love this app!
Works great and I never have any issues.
This application rocks !
Works great with the new front camera mirroring on the Archos 101!  Still have trouble finding it in the Market, but download from the developer site works. The Android market thinks that it's incompatible with my Archos 101IT Gen8, but it works so there's something wrong in the market specification.

It's a good app, even though I don't use it very often and sometimes it can't read the code, say if the colours don't have enough contrast

Aboslutely love. A bit slower than barcode scanner, but makes up for it in functionality. Would love to see an option to see technical detail about scanned QR (metadata and source text). Also love how author wen out of his way to satisfy the paranoia of some users and created a version without access to personal data. Definitele a thums up.

Once you start the app just point the camera at the QR code and it detects it automatically. No guesswork

I use this all the time. I taught seniors in my computer classes how to use QR Droid. Now they are running around with their email info on a QR Code!
This is the BEST QR READER!!!!
Its the best QR code maker i have found
This seems to be the *most* complete QR application. BUT STILL does not have the ability to use it as an input method. I know I am not the only one that wants this function. How come no developer can deliver? And no, I don't want a keyboard that has a scan function. I want a scanner that I can pull up in text box by long pressing and choosing it in "input methods". Is that too much to ask? 5 Stars once you get this feature. 6 Stars if I could. In fact, I'd pay $2.99 for this feature.
I have been using other scsnners but this one is the nicest
Works great! Easy to install and user friendly!
Awesomee..
so far this is the best code scanner in the market...!
well done but sometime it take a little bit longer.

It works when I go to use it . Interface is pretty straight forward .

QR code is getting more popular. This a handy app to read and create codes.

It could be 5 from me, but it's slow sometimes, and it keeps saying I have an available update when I don't, requiring a reinstall.
I love it. Works great.

Works like a charm. Great when your shopping to compare prices and look for reviews. My kids love it at a book store to quickly find reviews of books.

Cool. I was getting tired of typing/searching, now I can just scan and read. I guess that's why it's the NOW network.

One of the most complete apps I've downloaded. The only reason this wouldn't work is if your camera phone is horrible. Don't blame the developer.

I tried i-nigma first and it did nto work with my phone - could not access the camera. They claim compatibility with Japanese phones, and mine is an LG Optimus which is Korean origin. Anyway, this one works great and is fast. I would have installed the V4 Beta if I had seen it. I like that DroidLa gives the app for free, then you can choose to stop the ADs and promote the project by sending $1.50+ by PayPal to get a code to enter. Recommended by PC Mag is also encouraging.

Easy to use, good result and preview. Nice to have apps for instant barcode generated.
Gets the job done if you can wait around for a few minutes for it to recognize the QR. Camera keeps focusing and unfocusing. Found better app.
Awesome app! Create and decode on the fly. I use it for promotions and I also capture codes while I'm out and about.
Fast. Feature rich. Free. I have been using this little app about three months and love it!

Creating and scanning works flawlessly, allows shortcuts to specific functions for the home screen which I think is really useful. Scan time isn't always consistently short but it always does the job. Running on galaxy S2.

Takes ages to scan anything for me, if at all. Have found a faster replacement app. HTC Desire.
It sometimes has trouble focusing on close-up codes but otherwise it's a fantastic tool! It even reads UPC codes!
Great QR code generator! Image resizing features are a must when using this app on a large screen tablet device :)
This app is showing me a new level to explore in art... I might even try incorporating it into my ceramics
Works well, although tried to scan my hospital tag and it simply came up with loads of nonsense numbers and letters, akin to a programming language?

Great little app that I go to first whenever I find a QR code that I want to read.
Does not work well Cant read all Q.R. codes, & User interface is a bit awkward to use if these issues were to be sorted out then I would give a rating

Great must have, but needs some way to scroll the text you get after decrypting a image. Also, the codes should go to gallery so you can view them.

I use this with 'mybookdroid' instead of the default. It works very well, has better personalization options and is much better as a stand-alone too.

This and ShopSavvy are the only scanner apps I found that support my flash which makes scanning much easier.
Can't even scan a code in a magazine. Tries and tries even in great light and nothing. Just focusing Time to try another scanner this one's a POS.
Insanely cool!!! Even if you don't need it, download it. It is that cool. 6 stars. Lg optimus v.
WARNING, this is malware. After installing it, it said I "had a message", stupid me clicked on it and it began downloading something strange
I agree a with previous comment that the scanning process isn't very obvious, but this is by far the best qr scanner that I have yet found.

Why there are so many bad comments? Works great, never had any probs with scanning codes and does NOT drastically drain battery.
I thought it was really cool making codes from the website and then taking photos of them with my camera.

Awesome little app. Wish I could disable the flashlight button. I have no flashlight and my camera becomes unusable until I restart my phone :(
Doesn't feel very user friendly. I need something I can use quick without a learning curve.
