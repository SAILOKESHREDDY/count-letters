Like
Need to update this app. Not expected from OneLouder!!!
Wish to put 0 star but won't let me. Keeps on disconnecting and won't let me sign in again unless I reboot.
Zdh jhfdd
Connection lost?
No problem
It was awesome, but it won't let me sign in.. It said that i have bad internet connection but i still can watch YouTube with no buffering.. Please fix this bug, thanks..
Keeps logging me out. Then won't let me log back in. Not even worth the one star I gave it. Uninstalling.
Loads only the first message in the conversation if any...  Fix for 5 stars.
Keeps login in and never ends -.-
Like many others said it just kept saying that it was loading forever.
Very unstable, UI sucks.
When sending messages on my phone they didn't send and didn't even inform me that they didn't. Instead it seemed to think the messages sent and I only found out otherwise when on Facebook. Didn't receive messages either.
Still cannot send messages to mobile users, only people who are logged on through a pc, makes the app increasingly pointless as people become more mobile.
There should only one app for all.. Functions of fb
really need a lot of improvement go chat is far better then this   plzzz update with new features and dont miss to add that people can chat with more then one fb acc.
If you want an alternative for facebook official chat app try go chat...This stupid app force close all times and connects rarely. Waste of time
This app does not load do not install
Won't allow me to login. Worked first time then stopped.
The application could not log me in. Just pop up came to name the log in device and then nothing happened. The adds were refreshing so was my Whatsapp in background, so connectivity was not an issue. All this performance over a wifi network. Can't think how it would be over Edge. Uninstalling.
Always coming couldnt connect to chat try again later
Horrible downloaded it and it wont even open fix this crap
After logging in, you get stuck on a loading page,  rendering the app useless
ICS
Like FriendCaster, but dont recall downloading this! Uninstall.....
Hi

Super flop
It keeps crashing and I don't get any notifications. Still better than the official fb chat that doesn't work at all. But plz fix
It won't let me log in, for a second I thought the app was better than the facebook android... Smh
It constantly says unable to log it. I shut it down,reload and it works but when left idle it does it all over again. Big pain in the a$$! Uninstalling immediately! SUCKS!
Need to fix the bugs from the updates.  Page keeps refreshing.  Will not let you comment most of the time   won't let u like a page.
Keeps telling me login failed. Used to work.
Keeps telling me login failed. Used to work.

A 2.4mb download. That takes 30 mb of memory to run. Lags the hell out of my phone and just isn't worth it.
the chat has stopped working completely and I dont know why because it only happened about a week ago. please fix this it constantly says that it failed to log in

This is ridiculous. It won't even connect. I have tried both on my mobile network and wi-fi. And yet nothing. This is a problem that really need to be fixed.
You're lucky Joshua, mine only lasted for 3 hours before locking me out. Too bad were forced to at least give 1 star. Y'all, seriously need to fix these problems.
Good
Only worked the first time, after that always has issues signing in, can't see contacts, big mess, to fix this app they must start from scratch, dont waste your time, and space on this application.
I dnt want to rate this app Waste of time
Reinstalled twice, still getting an error message. HTC rhyme.
Won't even log me in Pathetic
Sexy app .
Every time I try to get on chat it doesn't let me. Keeps saying login failed so I've been able to use it about three times total and nothing after that.
My grandma works faster then this

Messages would never load. Progress circle constantly resetting. Is there ever going to be a fully functional and fast app for FB?
I Difficult to connect with ics4.0.4 on sgs2...  Is this developer lazy to update???? hello?
Cannot log in
Friendcaster works ok but I can never log in to chat...LG Revolution
Unfortunately this app just sits there loading after login.... Does NOT load existing msgs or chats if they were started in a different app.
It not all that good for Android it runs slow and always say "the chat has disconected" its poor
Lame
Doesnt work properly.Disappointing
Since I updated, it no longer works
All it says is Logging on to Chat, Lost Connection, and Attempting to reconnect even when my mobile network and Wi-Fi are turned on. Can't even get past the log in. UNINSTALL
Not works properly only errors r there.
Just waste of an app
Very bad app. Won't run. It just keeps saying it lost it's connection, and it won't uninstall.
I love this app... what happen now? It was better before, I cannot get most of the postings, every time I need to check my invitations is going right on the internet website. I was ready to buy it but now I have to wait... please fix.

It won't even let me sign in. Keeps saying connection lost and I have wireless connection. Very disappointed in this app. Unless the bugs are fixed this is a worthless app and a waste of time to even bother downloading.
Wont even let me log in
Fckd, can't login tried several times
Guys, this broken release has been out forever. Since the 27th. Its like the second week in May already. Why put your product on a market that has a rating system if you're not going to care when people actually give feedback. Bad form.
Will not connect. I've tried setting it up 4-5 times with nothing but error messages. Uninstalling.
Keeps losing connection and failing to recconect, often asking me to reenter my account details, not acceptable
Doesn't even work.
Once the update was done I can't upload pix to mi account... It don't show all my photo albums wen I go to upload a photo:( I wish this wld get fixed... & I can't tag ppl in comments like I can on the actual fb app
Does not show the contacts that are connected by phone
When in background, does not stay connected

Everything else is working...but I m not able to send msg from my side
Always disconnecting, only way to fix is clearing memory on Samsung galaxy s2
At first it was doing well..in fact, I deleted my facebook on my phone and just use this instead...but now everytime I type to update my status, it writes in white colour and in that case I obliviously couldn't see what I'm typing, I tried to shut my phone down and open it again but still the same :( I hope you could fix it cause I really liked it a lot..
They fixed it and it wasn't broke.  I can't get it to work at all now.
Tmobile Galaxy S2
Dnt Even Show Fb Login Page, sucks..
Always lost connection~ I really wanna to use because facebook one is not user-friendly~
I only get the first message someone sends me, then can't get any others until I log out and log back in again.  I e-mailed the developer about it, but they never replied.  I love the themes, but had to change to a Facebook chat app that actually works.
Just stopped Workin.. won't sign me in. Thunderbolt
Not able to access since update!
Shut
Used to love this app, now it doesn't even work Droid Charge by Samsung
I have two account in the friend caster app. When i try to log in for chat it doesnt show up anything. Plus it always logs me on from one account even if i am on my other account.. It.is annoying!!!
doesnt start frm when i hav downloaded pls fix this
It doesn't show allow button for facebook authentication in my samsung galaxy mini. Please fix it..
Kicks me off, then days trouble logging in
Slow as can be. Likes to lose connection, as well. I just don't see what's so difficult about making a Facebook /chat/ app.
where is the allow button????when it asks for permission while logging in.
It sounds like a flawless replacement for the buggy app Facebook dares to release. Too bad it won't log on on my tablet. It keeps trying to connect while the 'main' program of Friendcaster does not seem to have any problems.
Wow I was n one min n the next I cant get back n this sux
WHAT THE F*CK APPS!!!! UNINSTALLED!!! REALLY POOR APPS!!!
Cant even log in.. Uninstalling.
I cant log.in!!!
I cant log.in!!!
POOR POOR POOR 4 Samsung Galaxy when it comes up wiv NOT ALLOW or ALLOW this app you can't even press allow as it doesn't fit on phone page properly!!
Don't use this guys! Use gochat instead,it is soooooooo much better and it actually loads everything including your friends profile picture!!
I tried other Facebook apps they don't work properly. They tell me I need internet connection I had one. FriendCaster constantly works no internet issues. Thanks OneLouder!
I can't chat with this crap.another program are better.don't install this.wasting time n storage :p
Taking Wrong reference of facebook account and kick.the Chat for.no Reason. Samsung.note

Doesn't show all available friends, will not send messages or update properly.
I 'm so glad I didn't pay for this app. It won't log me in and technically hasn't  worked since I installed it a week ago.
Chat doesn't notify me when I have a new message, also logs me out when I leave the app. Messages are not sending, would be nice to tag people in pics that upload to Facebook
"dont allow" is my only option wtf? i will change rating as soon as someone solves this
Wont log in.
This app doesn't stay logged in.

Keeps saying "There was a problem logging into chat, please try again." I'm not a mind-reader. It let me save the device name, but now what's the problem? Uninstalling because it's taking up precious space.
Absolutely perfect. It works nicely and it's exactly what I was looking for. They seem to have fixed the logging in problem that everyone else is moaning about. Definitely keeping.

They need to fix the message option. It still doesn't work!
Very irritating it wont stay connected! Especially since the last update. Love this app when it works, please fix the connection issue
It seems to be so many people cannot log in.  Neithere, do I!  I have never been able to succeed to log in, yet, since I downloaded it.  Plz fix it.
Cannot log out. Wanna log in using other username also cannot!
Poor! cant sign in to chat.
To much losing connection!!!! FIX ASAP
Installed on a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, with Honeycomb 3.1. It works nicely on the tablet, has a pleasant interface and it's relatively fast and smooth. Definitely the best FB app for tablet I tried till now. However there are still a lot of bugs: just scrolling the news feed often it crashes, the profile pictures window is cut in half, you cannot accept friends request (it sends you to the browser), the message window is buggy (often does not display anything). I am using it, but honestly I would expect better apps for FB considering the ubiquity and popularity of this social network.
Just installed for first time and cannot log in. Wth is w all these fb chats not working!?!

Not syncing
I never been able to login and keeps telling me to try again later. When I do, it won't let me sign in. What's the point of this if you can't chat?
Ever since this app has had the last update iv'e constantly been having error messages.Doesn't show all status updates either.App has gone downhill.

Not as good as 'go chat' uninstalling. Doesnt vibrate/ alert if new message pops up!
I normally use IMO Messenger which is superb. I thought I have paid for Friendcaster Pro so I would install Chat. I have a HTC Desire S and its locks?
Notification sound is now working! Would love to see a pop up on lock screen!
For the last couple days no friends has showed up but when it worked it was fine

Removed from phone for lack of options. Pretty generic app, would consider it again if Dev's keep working to improve it. This app worked fine however.
Goodlook on the themes, and auto refresh. Would of loved this inter-graded with friendcaster Pro but this is the next best thing. And if we Know Chris Banes there would be a Pro version hopefully in a later update. Keep it up Glad its free for now but would pay for it with the improvements.
Keeps failing to log me in
Aftr I gt dis app ,i got 3 gals . I met thm n njoyng nw . . Came to b frnds frevr
Messages are not delivered reliably, but sometimes you have to close the chat and open it again. There is no good theme for AMOLED screens.
My god.,...this app horribly irritating me.Its not logging in...if login success,saying no friends available.developers gave useless solution in the FAQ.
Faster dn ny othr app but Everytime when i check ma notifications ..it takes me to the friend's wall ..who cmntd not to d actual post. Can't tag in comments or post . Cant post on friends wall xcpt photos. Cant chk frnd requests Need login agn wen to chat .
Very nice excellent......
awesome app
Every time I check my notifications it takes me to the person that commented page
good apps
this app us great when it keeps you logged in for more than five minutes. after which you have to keep huh ping clearing the cache on applications to login all over again after every use. it can be much much better
Nice!:)
It always disconnect. Please fix the issue.
The two stars for friendcaster. Chat is bad. Shows unable to login.
There is hellova room for error in ths App!!!! Improve th god damn app!!
I cant send messages most of the time and cant send or receive pictures. Im am using the paid pro version of Friendcaster. Plus fix so I can give higher rating. I have the galaxy note.
Gud app but takes too long logging in & won't let me see end of message after a <3
It would have been grand if it, or any facebook related app would care to so much as log me in. Please fix this bug as I am not the only one effected.
Can no longer check or respond to messages since last update. Back to 5 *'s when fixed
No multi user sign in
Obviously faster than the official fb app. But the profile pictures doenst show on my galaxy spica. Please fix this problem. And i'll give you a 5star
Messages don't work mytouch 4g slide 2.3 also redirects for friend requests and chat sucks lots of work to be done on this going back to official app
My autocorrect feature doesn't work on this app, which is bad when I need to type in Japanese!!! Its the only way I can change from hira to kana and without autocorrect, I can't type to my friends ㅠㅠ
There are so many problems with this app, I can't even begin to describe them all.  1st, it keeps disconnecting me.  2nd, when I try to reconnect, it keeps logging me out,  and giving me an error message. Fix it!!!!
Good app, works well. Could use better themes and be more customizable. It's Android, not iPhone. We should be able to customize our stuff.
I love the style and layout of this app, but if me and a friend post a <3 to eachother, i cannot see it. i often don't get shown the whole message :/
Chat doesn't work.
Motorola Droid x2 won't stay running in background. Constantly wants to restart and have me really sign in. Very annoying. Uninstall
where is the allow button????when it asks for permission while logging in.
This app is great for everything that it does BUT it keeps losing connection and logging me off even when i am connected over Wi-Fi.
This app does way too much right out of the box; so to speak!  I thought it would be simpler to use but it's too complicated for simple old me!  Uninstalled from my Samsung Infuse 4G.
Once I logged out the friendcaster chat, and I tried logging in again, I was directed to Facebook for android instead.... how come?? I thought integrated with friendcaster?? And, I always get logging in error and it didn't show any new  messages even though I actually got new message... please fix... SGS2 i9100g..
I cant even sign in to the chat. It keeps saying theres a problem

Should add offline messaging  so you can chat with people who are offline love the THEMES
Was working fine until up to an hour ago... Now I can't login and it keeps crashing
Just disappears! Asus Transformer
Very slow updates. Sometimes only once or twice a day. Doesn't slow all adds to wall.
Used to be good until new update now all chat goes strait to msg :-(
I cant reply to my messages n  Icant poke back n too many error notes its very baf. Please fix asap.
Please fix :)
The official app is quickly catching up... Seriously needs a delete button as well as the ability to filter or hide friends. The themes suck...
Wish I didn't have to log in every time I use this..
So I need to be able to have sounds and set status away/ busy. Oh, and we need Smileys..u know, stuff the regular fb app has. Y'all are better right?

Amazing! Works just as I hoped it would =^) so much better than the lame official FB app...boooooo to that gumpy thing. Wooo for Friendcaster! =^D
FINALLY its working ..
stopped working for me as well!
It would be a great app, if it would log me in & show my online friends. Fix it, and I will keep using it. :]

Waas Greatt Till Update. Now It Wont Even Let Me Logg In.
Omg! Are you kidding me? I'm chatting with à friend on fb for android but when I log in on friendcaster chat NO ONE'S ONLINE!!!?!?
Its official your facebook app great y cant u make ur chat that way as it very slow some times dnt loggin and crashes alot

Why is chat a different application. Why not integrat into friend caster. Also it's quite slow art times.
My screen is completely unusable can't chat using the D-pad needs to be fixed so I can chat without touchscreen
Its, ok, cant send photos like the other chats, and cant copy
SEEMS COOL BUT STAYS IN NOTIFICATIONS AND NOW SAYS NO FRIENDS AVAILABLE TO CHAT WHEN I SEE THERE ARE ON PC
Not better den Go chat But still ok Remove dis app nd join it Through friendcaster
Needs logout feature....uninstall
drained battery, can't change notification tone.... Needs more customization options. Uninstall for now. I have an evo.... Need what battery I have
I've been waiting dis app.. thanks to u all. But theres no image. Fix it plss.. it would be perfect if it has an images. Sony X8.
Gochat for facebook application is far better than this..we can't send pictures n videos with this application,5/5 if its integrated with friendcaster
Doesn't work 4me. Maybe if you have under 1000 friends, but super slow so idk if does what it says I like the idea & they actually are improving it ;)
Y do u need permissions for SD card when it can't be saved to the SD card
How to contact the developers? This app (tgt with friendcaster) still have a long list of work to be done. Firstly, the notif "tap here to chat" is stuck, notif for new chat isn't cleared even after being clicked, doesn't retrieve old convos (before using the app) and the list goes on
What's going on? Can't get logged in now. Would be a 5star if log in issue could get fixed.
At 1st, its working then hours passed.. It stopped working!! Why??!!! :'(
Fast !!but hangs some times
I can't login anymore, and also it won't running on background. Fix it, then it will be really great apps
I frequently can't log in! They keep saying there's problem logging in chat, please try again. I don't know what's the problem cause internet connection works just fine...
Works good
Serves its purpose
I like this app because you can change the theme!:) and i like the themes because there is PURPLE!(: \(^o^)/ but i dont like that you cant see your friends that are offline! o;
Love the app but I dont like how it auto disconnects from chat after a while. Usually I logon to MSN & FB Chat on when gaming so I can close all programs, But every 30mins my FB disconnects. If left disconnected long enough I have to restart the whole app or else it doesnt connet anymore.  REALLY annoying.
Very nice excellent......
nice
my facebook chat still offline... i just wan to always online everytime..please fixxx!!thx      t
Like it better than messenger
It keeps crashing and I don't get any notifications. Still better than the official fb chat that doesn't work at all. But plz fix
Asks for usr name pascode every time
It works bt have erorr in quick connection...
H
So my messages work now but I'm not getting notifications anymore. I checked all my settings and they're good. Fix it!
It wont let me log in!!
I love the chat interface. Works smooth and is easy to use. Sadly I've had problems in my Motorola defy running wiui 4 (ics) The login screen crashes after entering the user name and clicking on the password box. Conversely, it also crashes if I first enter the password and then attempt to enter the user name. I've cleared data and cache as well as reinstating and still no joy. Can only enter data into one field before crash to launcher. 5 starts if this was fixed
Love the facebook app but the chat app forcloses alot
why notification related to comment on posts n if close friend put something, we don't  get notification . please fix this issue.
Doesn't notify you when you get a new message though
Alright
Cannot log in
Cannot log in
It crashes and says "error" quite a bit. Other than that, it's great!
Always forced closed nowadays. Please fix it! Thank you! :-)
Was great now it says 100% error when and ever time I try to like .. it worked fi e yesterday ...plz fix loathe app and beside the txt chat messenger sucks very very slow and says error the aol it self is good ... Photon 4G
Trying to love it
No option to copy text
Always disconnecting, only way to fix is clearing memory on Samsung galaxy s2
Great...best ...but dent sync with friendcaster app...just the original fcbk for adroid app Sort it owt
Ter s no option to change d notification tone(oly default)..!! Fix it, otherwise gud..:)
Nice app. But it is annoying when you write a post that the font colour is white & I can't see ....milestone xt720
The interface is good, but I want to recieve my messages and chats notification seperately. I turned off FriendCaster notification and I cannot particularly turn on the chat notification... :(
Used to work, but suddenly, it would not login into my Facebook chat. Will rate 5 once fixed!!  Nexus S on 4.0.4 stock
Not bad !
I seem to be able to do everything I need to except view new private messages. When I try to read them I get an error that says "unsupported get request". - Samsung Vibrant
Since the upgrade....... None of the notification settings work! Still getting all notifications when certain ones have been unchecked. Please fix or will have to use another FaceBook app!
That's it.
It worked fine at first, but then it started force closing and going offline so i gave up :{(
Great app mostly especially uploading photos, always seems to mess about when trying to send a message though :-(
Slow as can be. Likes to lose connection, as well. I just don't see what's so difficult about making a Facebook /chat/ app.
The app is fairly great, however it has some quirks they could improve on.
It is constantly "losing connection" on my 4G Motorola Photon (which forces me to log out and back in), and I constantly have issues logging in. If these get fixed, this would be a great product and I would change my rating. Have not yet uninstalled.
Masuk k,chat agak lemot
Don't use this guys! Use gochat instead,it is soooooooo much better and it actually loads everything including your friends profile picture!!
It's great but when I want to login it didn't login 
That why I will remove it :(
And I go out but when I open
Nothing happen it just loading
Can't view offline friends, can't see previous chat history, very little customizability besides changing the colors.
This app works, when it's not complaining about being disconnected every 10 min. Needs the ability to silently auto-reconnect. Also LED blink on incoming message would be nice.
Whenever I favorite someone and exit out and comeback its  not favorited anymore
The bubbles are big and they don't sticl together when it's the same person talking consecutively.
Llike the friendcaster app, this needs to be able to access more than one.acct at a time
Llike the friendcaster app, this needs to be able to access more than one.acct at a time
Chat doesn't notify me when I have a new message, also logs me out when I leave the app. Messages are not sending, would be nice to tag people in pics that upload to Facebook
Problems logging in. Please fix............
And no chat option
No chat. News feed returns multiple posts on same feed. Problems reading messages. Better than fb for android right now.
Yes, it seems good and there are many interesting options but some weak points: 1) I'm just able to read messages, not to write them. 2) In the separated chat the online people are always the same and I cannot update them. fix it please. samsung galaxy 2 (android 2.3.5). Thanks
This app doesn't stay logged in.
This app is starting to become unstable. Unable to reply to messages, it can't cope with swap from 3G to wireless, stuff won't update... Needs to be sorted.
It won't let me log in!
At least every other day, this app logs me out (a second chat icon appears in the notification blind and says, "Tap to reconnect). When I do this, it always says it can't log me in, forcing me to close the app and relaunch it to log back in.  Please either eliminate the disconnections altogether or at least allow the app to log me back in automatically.   Thank you.
HTC Wildfire.  On running the app, it asks to confirm permissions, but the "Allow" button does not appear on the screen (even when scrolled to the very bottom) and cannot be accessed.
Installed on a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, with Honeycomb 3.1. It works nicely on the tablet, has a pleasant interface and it's relatively fast and smooth. Definitely the best FB app for tablet I tried till now. However there are still a lot of bugs: just scrolling the news feed often it crashes, the profile pictures window is cut in half, you cannot accept friends request (it sends you to the browser), the message window is buggy (often does not display anything). I am using it, but honestly I would expect better apps for FB considering the ubiquity and popularity of this social network.
Just did an update and now it won't open (grrr) Keep getting an error msg..
Some bugs in notification...it cant open some time..and even it sm times goes to browser..
Very slow updates. Sometimes only once or twice a day. Doesn't slow all adds to wall.
I like the color theming and grid of friends pics.  Could use typing notification.
Works fine it's just there's a lot of errors since the update.  Disappointed.  :(
Its alright dosen't leave logged in always having to sync.. better than others..
Is there no way of integrating this with the main friendcaster app, or has sum1 tried that already?
I prefered this app before the updates, and keeps getting constant chrashes. Please fix it?
Best hai
Best hai
Notifies that I have new messages but when I check there's nothing there, when in fact I do have new messages. Please fix. I don't want to uninstall.
Excellent
Loading friends list each every times... loading list also late.. need customizeble notification sound. current active chatting friends on top always
Make the app with a chat list so you don't have to flip thru all your friends to see who's sending you an IM thnx. Carmen
Its okay I dnt get my chats all d time
no smileys,list view should also be given and consecutive message should be in same bubble
every time I send a Smiley (any kind of them) they don't show it just a blank space even when a person is sending u one please thank you
It works but doesnt show my friends picture,just a blank square apart from this I like it
Old fashioned..nt attractive
Worx well. Doesnt have many features what it says so, but those it has - worx good. Simple fb chat client. I use it only with Friend Caster app.
Make an option to list view friends list and u will get my 5 stars
The themes r cool but no notification sound n you can't show others that your busy like other apps. Its average.
Seems ok so far, login takes a while unlike other apps. Is there a way to have the layout in list form rather than grid? If not maybe an idea!
Make it so it doesn't log out everytime you exit friendcaster. Themes are nice though keep it up
THIS WILL VERY WONDERFUL AND COOL... OK
Notification sound is now working! Would love to see a pop up on lock screen!
Amazing! Works just as I hoped it would =^) so much better than the lame official FB app...boooooo to that gumpy thing. Wooo for Friendcaster! =^D
For the last couple days no friends has showed up but when it worked it was fine
Works great, will give 5 stars when you add ability to attach photos,voice clips etc.......!!
Decent app but same problem with logging in! Won't let me as much as I try, basically useless app now! desire hd.
Good app better then facebook for android, needs a top news and a most recent news option for the news feeds....please make an update asap!!!!
Not work (V.1.4) on Galaxy S
Can't log in. Please fix this.
Its not connecting to chat... :(
Doesn't seem to work at the moment, but i'm sure it'll be fixed soon. Until then, please add an option to disable the constant status bar icon. Thanks
Idea was very good, whole app isn't.. for.ex:why reloading contacts again and again when I turn screen?..for now thanks god for imo.im:)
Not as good as Go Chat for Facebook and doesn't stay logged in.
App works well. Please add the ability to have it start automatically when the phone starts.
Don’t login auto
Developer pls provide a auto message facility while a user is away....Appreciate your immediate response....
Still has some bugs, but the developer actively responds to feedback and fixes bugs quickly!
It's very slow....really disappointed....it doesn't deserve the "friendcaster" tag....
Good so far!
Seems alright for now, add gets annoying would be nice if it wasnt right above the keyboard.
Love it....better facebook for android.
Works good but wood be better if it was a plug-in to friendcaster an not an actual app
Works good but wood be better if it was a plug-in to friendcaster an not an actual app
Runs smoothly and works fine but I want a search-button! when added I'll give it 5/5
Not better den Go chat But still ok Remove dis app nd join it Through friendcaster
Needs logout feature....uninstall
I would like this app to be more responsive in pull/push messages, online/offline profiles and message grouping. Too many wasted space.
Keeps running non-stop in the background :/
Cant open my photos... keeps on loading. Help pls! Despite of that... its better than the rest.
Changed the theme and the pictures came up, if anyone was having trouble. Pretty basic, we'll see how it works...
Too high frequency of updates.... If content updates were reliable, on demand, then it would be worth the cash.
Goodlook on the themes, and auto refresh. Would of loved this inter-graded with friendcaster Pro but this is the next best thing. And if we Know Chris Banes there would be a Pro version hopefully in a later update. Keep it up Glad its free for now but would pay for it with the improvements.
I love this app. I purchase Friendcaster pro and the Friendcaster chat app still has ads. Other than that it works really good.
Its a good app
So far that Im using it, its better that the other apps..i just suggest that add more something on it so that it will be the best.. :-)
Faster dn ny othr app but Everytime when i check ma notifications ..it takes me to the friend's wall ..who cmntd not to d actual post. Can't tag in comments or post . Cant post on friends wall xcpt photos. Cant chk frnd requests Need login agn wen to chat .
Nice
Downloadable
Specifically, I find that it often will not load comments more than once per time I use the app... And messages are iffy.
awesome app
i have a problem with this app. although i believe it may be some setting mishap on my device. i have a motorola i867 (nextel) and i love this app cept for one thing..i cant see any photos anywhere! news feed timeline, homepage..nothing. had the same problem with the original facebook for android app. but i still like this app way more. lots of awesome features that the other app didnt have...please help!
Hi
Good app.
Good app but uninstalling until connection issues are fixed!
Messages and profiles are not loading .....app keeps on loading forever
please fix.Il give u five star.If you fix
Can't get rid of status bar icon. Other than that great.
love it!!!!        ~sonte~
Whenever i make it in my bar screen i cant log back in
This is a great app but the only thing bugging me is that I can't see the ones that are in FB mobile, it only displays the one that are on pc, any help?
Is ok I like it
Gud
like this
Good but go chat is much better
Awesome the most fastest one
It's gud for those people who really love to chat on Facebook.....  ;-)
It's a great app!! But... It won't let me check my friends request unless  I go to the actuall internet and  I got this app so  I wouldn't have too!!!
Would be better if you had the chats your chatting with at the top for faster access
but it could be awesome with the move to SD Card feature. 16Mb is too much for my little smart phone - Samsung Galaxy Prevail
I love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!
You're lucky Joshua, mine only lasted for 3 hours before locking me out. Too bad were forced to at least give 1 star. Y'all, seriously need to fix these problems.
Not receiving notifications until I open application, please fix.
im 13 and facebook-crazed its fucking gr8 if u dont lyk dis u'll lyk  "Go!Chat For Facebook"
Greatest
Message doesn't work. EVO 4G :(
You got my 5Stars but include twitter app mehn and ability to posts to all facebook account at a time
Its gd
Nice app. Should fix l0g.
Works perfectly for me. But one thing I don't like is the fact that it doesn't show mobile users.
nice but not more than go chat....would be better
Nic app
Doesn't run in background.and now I can't even connect..it was working all yesterday ><
شكرا
Everything else is working...but I m not able to send msg from my side
I like it so far!
Great app but it never notifies me of a new message.. Plz fix and I give 5 stars.
Love the new style... New update doesn't show letters when typing a post on anothers page... Samsung galaxy s
Good not bad
I really like it!
Great app Im just not able to send facebook messages
Good app, works well. Could use better themes and be more customizable. It's Android, not iPhone. We should be able to customize our stuff.
Wow :))
Its ok on my lg optimus me and samsung galaxy SII.But needs regular bug fixes and updates.
The app has a nice layout and is easy to use but everything seems to be pixelated and low quality
Good..
This is better and faster than facebook for android
Cool
nice but please fix,some times can't load images,send the message,log out when minimize....
Keep going back and forth between this and plain fb. Diff options on each.
Why much quicker than fb messager
not bad at all works fine on my Galaxy young
Problem with the allow button.. Try signing in in the landscape mode..
They need to fix the message option. It still doesn't work!
To much losing connection!!!! FIX ASAP
Kool-Mo-Dee!
Kool-Mo-Dee!
Facebook for Android is crap next to Friendcaster. Works great!
its showing login error.....everytym i login....then it shows that no friends available to chat...please help!! X(
Would get 5/5 if when messaging it didn't send you to the Facebook website
Getting killed by thee system and that causes the push notifications not to work
Not bad
i love it but its slow bogged down with adds, chat is slow to sometimes. my battery now drains charge twice as fast. When I close it restarts my phone
Pretty good:) but it could be better, my friends's pic doesn't show up, the app is kinda slow and if you can add something that shows that I'M online
The only thing Idont like that Icant reply to my messages..other then that Ilike it.... Gotta add poke as well to it.... Thanks
why does it keep logging me out can you please ask someone how to fix this so I can delete the stupid regular facebook app
Other then a few bugs, the only thing missing is being able to @ a contact when commenting. It's everything. Loves the new layout! !
Nice app
Ever since FC update I've had trouble logging into chat. Fix this and messaging then I'll bring back 5 stars.
Better than the official one.
Better than the official one.
Much better now thank you
Love it but need to post on own pages as page, and to reply to messages from within app. Also delete messages.
Make the app with a chat list so you don't have to flip thru all your friends to see who's sending you an IM thnx. Carmen
Wish I didn't have to log in every time I use this..
I love it! But there is just one thing I dislike bout it tho. When I update my profile pic it doesn't show on the app but it'll show on the mobile web
It's really nice! Plus it can b moved to d SD card:) a lil slow thou, but overall its gr8 to reach FB friends! Wish they had better themes :(
Love it but wish the updates wouldn't cause the filter to story working...please fix...doesn't filter anymore
Give us the option to make the friends lust to show up as a list rather than a grid
Would be nice to have: - list view - away if screen off
So far,so good. No problems.
Better than the facebook app chat by far but it keeps refreshin quite often for some reason though
Better than fb for android chat
I normally use IMO Messenger which is superb. I thought I have paid for Friendcaster Pro so I would install Chat. I have a HTC Desire S and its locks?
Notification sound is now working! Would love to see a pop up on lock screen!
And it needs to show ongoing and new chats separately. Do something so it never logsoff
Logs in quickly and shows contacts fine. Using Advent Vega running Vegacomb 3.2 B8.1. Only thing stopping me giving it 5 stars is that when you want to look at the contacts profile it will only use Friendcaster. Give it the ability to use Friendcast for Tablets.
Will be great after contact syncing works.
Great App, continue to improve
Works great, will give 5 stars when you add ability to attach photos,voice clips etc.......!!
Works fine for me
It was working awesome until today; now it says "problem logging in". I'm sad.
Doesn't connect to chat plz fix its 1 of my fav apps
Love It!Except For Somtimes It Doesnt Allow Me To Reply Please Fix!
The send button has stopped working. I now cannot send messages. Very handy..... (HTC desire running gingervillain)
Works just fine. Hate the constant tap here to chat icon in the notification bar when active.
The app is updated with new features that move it toward being a fully featured chat app. Given two months, I expect it will be the best on the market
Keeps glitching when loading the profile pictures and unresponsive when replying to a messages sometimes
Absolutely great! (SGS I)
Awesome & easy!!
not able to see if the person is offline or away or available during chat.shud show me if a friend is typing a message
Better than Android Fb.
My screen is completely unusable can't chat using the D-pad needs to be fixed so I can chat without touchscreen
Its okay!
I like it so far. Very user friendly
I luv it ;-)
I never chatted on facebook mobile, till now.
Add option to poke
Works good but wood be better if it was a plug-in to friendcaster an not an actual app
Needs some work but love the idea
Runs smoothly and works fine but I want a search-button! when added I'll give it 5/5
Won't send any messages, keeps acting like if I didn't even press send. Huawei Ascend
I have to admit that this works even better than the facebook chat! You guys are incredible!
Just installed and so far so good ...although the writing on conversations could be a bit bigger ! But all good all in all
I've been waiting dis app.. thanks to u all. But theres no image. Fix it plss.. it would be perfect if it has an images. Sony X8.

I love your app! :)

Motorola Droid x2 won't stay running in background. Constantly wants to restart and have me really sign in. Very annoying. Uninstall
It sounds like a flawless replacement for the buggy app Facebook dares to release. Too bad it won't log on on my tablet. It keeps trying to connect while the 'main' program of Friendcaster does not seem to have any problems.

great app, better than default facebook app for sure, so much option and great interface. But I have problem with chat, my friend want to send me a message and when he type and want to send in text bar appear some yelow triangle and 'this message failed to send, click to send again'. When Im not on chat I get message in inbox without problem.
Works nicely!
Excellent for FACEBOOK.
Don't use this guys! Use gochat instead,it is soooooooo much better and it actually loads everything including your friends profile picture!!

Love it
Brill,  replaced the official Facebook app on my x10
I like the color theming and grid of friends pics.  Could use typing notification.
I would like to Highlight  what my friends or chatting to me in Friend Caster  can read it back to me and chatting will be as  fun as    facebook…Okay!!!	Miss independent I had a stroke  in the right hemisphere of my brain very limited but I can speak whale friend caster open me up to a whole new social

Works but disconnects all the time, need to be able to set separate notification for disconnect
It says in the description that it is having problems. Why review? I'm sure it'll be great when fixed!
stopped working for me as well!
Y dosent everyone get a samsung galaxy s it works perfect on mine keep up the good work....
I love Friendcaster. Its awesome when away from my laptop. Helps me keep in touch in real time without texting. Im between cell providers, is great!
It is constantly running in the background. I can't kill it without rebooting the phone.
I'd give it 10 stars. Since the last update it's brilliant! Get rid of the ads tho :-(
The app is updated with new features that move it toward being a fully featured chat app. Given two months, I expect it will be the best on the market
how do u close a convo if ur done chatting? or can u not? other than that, great
Super super super super awesome!!!!
Keeps glitching when loading the profile pictures and unresponsive when replying to a messages sometimes
Great! Doesn't force close, doesn't kill my battery, doesn't take up tons of space! Its quick, easy and to the point! Needs more options/settings tho!
Absolutely great! (SGS I)
This good app
Love this app, it still has a few things to add like being able to respond to messages through reply and not the chat app, but otherwise great app
Slowed my phone down...didn't do anything after I selected login to chat...uninstalled

Ok its new but one thing it will get better if you send them feedback they do listen unlike the official fb app developers
