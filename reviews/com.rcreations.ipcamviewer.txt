Works great for Talos H.264 dvr system. Make sure this app is up to date. Also do not forget to set the 4 channels on app for cams.
Want to test audio before paying ten bucks after reading there r still foscam issues in full app comments
I have a droid x app works great it stopped working after a few days It just has red downloading cameras. help!
Great app! a must! I have been looking for that a long time - I have bought it directly - works very fine with my linksys & sitecom cams - Domi
Don't not upgrade! All you will get is an add for two more cameras, that's it!
A great app I have tried several and this is the only one I could get to work with droid

Great app! Great support setting up for non-techies. Always know what is going on @ home.
Excellent, works flawlessly on my evo, 3g works great, haven't tried WiFi or 4g yet but should be even better!
Really love viewing security & street cams from anywhere. Dev updates regularly. Get this! Epic 4g.
I monitor 6 Foscams and an 8-channel Geovision GV2008 with this app an it works flawlessly, 20x faster than trying to use browser. Droid1
I think Donny is a little childish. .I've been using this for 5 months on my droid x to access my webcam xp serverand it's just awesome
THIS APP JACKED UP MY GALAXY TAB, IT CORRUPTED MY MARKET, IT PUT SOMETHING ON MY SD CARD, DO NOT DOWNLOAD!
If you are trying to view Memphis give it up. They are technologically retarded here. Same pictures stay up for weeks.
Awesome works flawless with my EyeSpy247ptz using generic settings and the developer is adding native support in the next version!

Cool app, works great, needs a little getting used to configuration, but then runs fine!
i thought that this app was going to let u choose a nearby camera- it says that i selected japan when i cant even select!
Hey, it works. Install, point to IP camera address and view. Apps the way they should be. Even supports ptz motion control.
On galaxsy s2 android 4.4
I have the paid version but every time it downloads an update it then forgets my licence code so it reverts back to the free lite version. I tried contacting the developer but no response.
Don't get will not work
Don't get will not work
LLLLLAAAAAMMMMMEEEEEE
Can we load back early version?
This app quit showing cameras on DROID 3. used to work good, but not after update!
I see too soon new update n that tooo too big..difficult to keep updating phone every by n then....also still not able tolocate mycameras1
Pkg file invalid
You cant do anything ut wont let u
I can't view live cams from any where what is this
Please fix for Jelly Bean.  Works with my Trendnet. Ads are a bit annoying and price of full version has gone up. Does what I need for now
I bought the pro version, it was OK, nothing special. Six days later, I was prompted to update. I did, and was charged AGAIN for the WHOLE APP, AND IT DID NOT EVEN INSTALL IT! WHAT A SCAM! MINUS 100 STARS!  Try the one from the DMV.
not working! total waste of time and energy.. i burned 2 calories just trying to get it work..
Idk if it's my phone, but I can't connect when using 3g, only wifi:/  otherwise it's better than the app that came with our security system
Looks like some states don't want u too know  what's going on keep getting camera feed not available so got rid of it
Meye is working flawlessly but this software cannot connect regardless of make/model I choose. It's crappy!
Does not work just see black squares
Worst experience. Not connecting.
Old Samsung 1040k dvr & swann dvr both running( Samsung doesn't even support that model
This apps is not working onthe google tv am i doing something wrong?
Wouldn't work with my DROID phone!
This a great app, many manufacturers already available, really easy to setup, follow instructions on website and you'll be viewing your cams in no time at all. I installed the app that came with system, very hard to setup, poor video quality, not IP Cam Lite. Better all the way, I will soon upgrade. Thanks for an excellant app.
sucks
sucks
Doesn't work.
Sucks...Myrtle Beach and Spring Maid Beach cams needs updated 1 of 5 works.
Not workin on s2
Doesnt work
Sgdvfvfbhy its cool
Does not work with LG Android smart phone Can not find path
what a waste of time! only a handfull of live cams. uninstalling.
Would not connect to my qsee dvr. I currently use supercam which connects to my dvr perfectly, but i was looking for an app that supported 7+ inch screens. Tried everything but no luck. Oh well.
No traffic cams working in Hawaii
Great smooth app... Free too
Last update wiped all my cameras :(
Application contains build in merchandising excrements!
The only app. that works with  my cam. Thanks for your help, Mr Chou.
Since last up date no good the cams I want r now gone
Rubbish. Deleted.
This program auto-starts at phone bootup and keeps running.  This s l o w s bootup, drains battery, and who knows what else.  Now uninstalled.
Doesn't work with my cameras,  NO support or response from author,  even on his own forum. Wish it worked.
Mpv IP v
U can only see 1 street please up date to give more stars don't know what country yr in Im in Australian there's nothing here
Crashes on HTC Sensation 3 seconds after launching. Not willing to purchase full version if the free version doesn't work.
Been using for a while and has been great but latest version is keeping phone awake and draining battery
Will not update OptimusM- Android vers. 2.2
Great app! Better than I had expected it to be. Very simple to set up and use.
With a little help of my video installer got this app to work. Not sure what's the difference from the paid version but it works great! . No playback.
This app works perfectly. The consisent updates prove it is one of the best supported programs on the market. I watch home, business, traffic cams..
Great cm viewer.But needs to be able to play video playback in pro version. What good is recording if u cant view the vid...?
Pretty good except it registers an intent to open image URLs. That's really annoying.
I have no clue why people are hating on this app. Works wonders. Sony Ericcson Xperia X10

Had a problem but did a hard reset now its working again. Very nice app.
Excellent App after installing new cameras, I can view and move them even from hundreds of miles away... more convenient than a computer....
Its easy and perfect !!!! Five star!!!!
Slow my phone down soooooo bad. Not a great app even if it didn't slow my phone down.
Works great. Interface isn't the prettiest, but it definitely works as advertised.
Works great. Interface isn't the prettiest, but it definitely works as advertised.
Works great. Easy to setup. I'd highly recommend it, especially over the "official" security camera apps, ie. Swann.
I love this app! I use it with my 16 channel nightowl dvr system over t-mo!
works before...but update the new version.... cannot connect to the IPCam again....pls check

Wish traffic cams were better... But this is cool I'm currently watching my university it is live and never lags lol
Works pretty good. Won't work on my cams, issue between password logon. And user name. TB 2.2.1
This app is awesome on my Evo. I'm able to keep an eye on my baby when away from home. Love it! Exceeded my expectations.
Excellent app. When my camera didn't exist in the app the writer added it quickly.
Chou. I updated today and it stopped working camera not available camera not available not available why.... Again update broke it. Trying again...
This application has allowed for me to view two different types of camera in NY from other countries, giving me peace of mind wile im away from home
This is the bestvapp out there !!! Would be nice if u can update from lite to pro from lite app
Hate the new icon if we have the lite version even if we have the activation code
Don't have any cams in my area and camera's just stick. Tried a fast broadband connection and still no difference.

It was very easy to get my cameras set up. Both a Panasonic and a few Toshiba models.

People shouldn't give this app 1 star just because your to dumb to work it.5 stars great app!
Not bad. Like browser integration. Paid version not worth $US4.99, especially when there are *many* other similar apps around.
This is a very fun program for checking traffic, personal security, or exploring other cities. :-) --G1
I use it to check the roads b4 go'n 2 work. This is a very helpful app , it works well on my samsung epic thx.

More than I expected. Droid X. Loftek CXS 2200 IP Webcam. Very easy config. I can view my webcam on my phone from anywhere.
I don't understand what this app is for. Please, someone explain to me. It only shows four cameras in new York, Netherlands and two other places??????
Lite version literally does nothing except show four cameras pointless . Someone explain!!!!!
This app would be better if I could shoot lasers out of the camera. Lethal ones.

good apps and works fine with my ipcam at home, not complicated as long as you have ipcam url ready for set up.
Tried the free trial and had to purchase. Gets updated constantly for new features. This app well worth buying.
I already bought it I'm using a Linksys (Cisco) WVC210 The best app in the market especially after that they enable the sound option
Amazing app! I think the cameras look better on my phone than on my computer. Best support around. Thanks for the hard work.

Works great, more than 3 cameras you will have to buy the full version which is a bargain. Developer has great support.
Lets me view my dog ip camera from work! So cool! Could be a little less laggy but other than that great! Droid X
Awesome works flawless with my EyeSpy247ptz using generic settings and the developer is adding native support in the next version!
This app rocks, i can see traffic by my house, beach by bro in law in new zealand, where husband grew up in NY, sis college classroom! Samsung moment
Very impressive. 4 stars do to only preloaded cams being live feeds. Prob need to buy full version to get live feed on your setup. Great job though.
Very cool app! I love it. Works great on my LG Apex. Traffic cams work flawless. Thanks!

App only stays running in bg if you use widget. That's not the app's fault it's how widgets work. Conspiracy theories re spyware without proof = dumb
Can somebody help me?..I put in my IP address for my comp and it wont detect my webcam..and what is the username and password?
Great app! Love using it to show off my phone! Lol cant wait to hook up my own wireless ip cams at home! Moto-droid 2.2 froyo
No instructions. Just "We think everyone is tech saavy so we aren't telling you how to install a cam" so im deleting.
Watz up wit thizz. Iam in kali. not in japan. I wana c da BAY AREA
Great app, works very well with myq-see cameras. Installed on HTC Aria Android 2.1 Thanx a bunch.
Did not work with ipcam ordered from chinavasion. Web browsers work fine with my cams. This is not a portable ipcam app. I do not recommend. Pwnd!
This is perfect for Q-See DVR, it shows 4 cams right on your screen! Simple configuration, small ads, I love it!
Works, but the ad is gigantic and overlayed on top of the image. Plus no audio with Linksys. Ill buy the full version once I can get audio.
Didn't work with my Foscam Christopher what did you do that I didn't? Moto Droid
Purchased and used daily for home webcam viewing, reliable and full-featured when using Panasonic cameras. Makes me want to buy more cameras!

Very good app,who would have thought that you could see live moving pics on yer mobile anywhere in the world,marvellous.
It's like it supports every manufacturer but mine, Artnix. I'm dying for a reason to buy the full version and give it 5 stars.
i dont get it its the same as paid and you only get 4 on both :l still fun to show friends though :D
Works very well. Updates often but no big deal. Sometimes wonder what the updates are, a solid useful app though. Keep it up.
Great app, however it is against app market rules to have paid version inside app link to paypal. Please add pay ver to market.
Good app, very easy to set up, works geat with my camera- select cam model, put Ip, port and watch. Use on 3g or on wifi, then picture is smooth.

Call me "to dumb" to use it if you want but the app is just way to hard for the average person to use, need to make it more user friendly

Works amazingly well with my Panasonic cameras. Picture is crystal clear. Image loads fast, much faster than it loads on my computer. Motion is smooth
This camera is showing me somewhere in the world, not where I live, gps doesn't work, no location selecter.... useless. .. uninstall!
Rob is the man and this is one of the best apps available in the market. Clean easy to use GUI. Support this app and buy full version. They earned it!
This app is starting to lose my respect...after the update the cameras i had set up are now gone!
You just want everyone to pay for it now...uninstall
I will glady pay for the paid version if you add preset control to Trendnet IP400
Wow... I requested to support my babycam with demo site provided. In a few days. My babycam is supported with pan and tilt control... Five star!!!

Warning, the latest version downloads and displays ads from unknown sources, uninstalling
I used to have this installed on my Xoom Tablet and it worked perfectly fine. I took it off for a while because I wasn't using it, to free up some space.  I  just tried to install it again and the install program says it is NOT compatible with my Xoom and won't let me Install the Program.  What gives? This sucks!
Its only photos am getting
For days now i have not gotten any feeds. Fix
No audio
Hard to work
Way too many updates. What's really being changed??? How about a changelog?
Crashes to much to slow
Unprofessional user interface with all buttons squeezed....
Works great on my HTC thunderbolt for my qsee cameras at work.
Needs to support more airlink models so it's possible to view all vendor cams in 1 app- axis, airlink, etc- for homes & office clients. Uninstalling.
Will not update OptimusM- Android vers. 2.2
Great app if it didn't constantly run in the background. - can we please have the option of deciding if/when we start the app?
This app works perfectly. The consisent updates prove it is one of the best supported programs on the market. I watch home, business, traffic cams..
Need to make it simpler. And it will not let me see my area? Show better directions. I want to see my whole house.
Works great. Interface isn't the prettiest, but it definitely works as advertised.
I love this app! I use it with my 16 channel nightowl dvr system over t-mo!
works before...but update the new version.... cannot connect to the IPCam again....pls check

Hate the new icon if we have the lite version even if we have the activation code
Works with my sentinent Cams / dvr and my HTC desire. Really good app, thank you. 5* from me!
poor app but there are only a few locations in uk and they are London Wales and bath there are many more places like the midlands potential 2 b gr8
Great app! Great support setting up for non-techies. Always know what is going on @ home.
Works perfectly with my HTC Wildfire and Edimax IP camera. Actually faster than the PC Explorer viewer

Why use an awesome free app when you can pay for a semi-crappy one? lol ...uninstalled
Can someone tell me are the beach cams just still photos I have no movement can anyone help me please
It's like it supports every manufacturer but mine, Artnix. I'm dying for a reason to buy the full version and give it 5 stars.
I don't know how to change the address and I wish that it had more direction or more information on what to do and this is khalilah this is my number

Developer was very fast adding support for y-cam afer giving demo site with camera image.
I will glady pay for the paid version if you add preset control to Trendnet IP400
Great app but need per camera u/n and pw. Also, any plans for pixord support?
Tried to fill in the requested network info but failed, however the scan method worked.
But definitely not my favorite ip cam viewer.
Installed on a no-name Android tablet, connected to a storage options camera using a free no-ip domain name and.... bingo. Internet access to my IP camera.
No
...possibly the ugliest app I've ever seen. The interface needs a lot of work.
Needs an exit or close option.  Runs in background and uses a lot of battery and data.  Amaze running ICS.
I like it but it updates every week. Very odd, unless they want to bump the app in the market.
Acer iconia a100 ICS and Motorola Titanium with Froyo over wifi. With Axis cameras.
Developer is constantly updating. Very annoying
Ok
Good
whats changed and why is there almost 2 updates a week. otherwise great free app.
Works great. Its free. Its ugly and low resolution . I'd love a UI refresh.
DLink camera signal works great on Netgear Router WNDR 3300. ONLY WORKS when close to home.
Use lorex l23wd with my lh600 d works .
Great smooth app... Free too
One the best programs available to droid.
After last 2 updates, from 6 cameras only 1 can be viewed using this app. Tried with PC and web, no probs. Please fix. Cameras are Panasonic SP105 and BL-C1. Thanks
No audio support. Galaxy S
loved previous versions as there were subtle ads, but now take up too much screen with banner. Uninstalled
I can view all 5 of my cameras at my house even simultaneously. Three cameras are IP and 2 are USB. I was able to use this software along with WebCamXP to get my USB cameras. Great App!!!
I like the interface but the 6 camera limit was not stated in the description.  By ot saying wht limits it has kinda turns me off
Hi guys, am using sony ericsson x8 (2.2 android) and am planning to connect the cam to my phone from my laptop. i have HP webcam 101. i dont know how to connect. need help. thanks.
Works as expected.  Useful app.
Better than nothing but I need sound. I have 2 Evos and $20 is just too much for something Webkit SHOULD be doing for free.
Not sure if it is my system or the app. I could not get it to recognize my own camera in Honeycomb but it did find the default cameras that it loads the IP's for. The annoying part was trying to find a procedure that would allow you to add a camera, in the end I could not tell if it would support an internal web cam or not.
Video works but free version has no audio, so it's useless for me as a baby monitor app. Would never buy pro w/o being able to test audio.
Please explain permissions to start on boot and record audio. Also this latest update has no different change log from at least last update.
Great app like that i can see multi cams but its running super slow frame rates compared to meye that came with my q-see system. HTC evo 2.3
All my cams in one place!
I would like to decide when it runs.. Other than that, this seems like a stable, useful app.
Last update is killing the battery even when not in use. Otherwise great application.
Works great as a baby monitor on my X10, using a trendnet tv-ip422w. Love the ability to hear my baby.
Pretty good except it registers an intent to open image URLs. That's really annoying.
Well done Robert, best aps, fast, clear,easy setup. Working great on my htc. Highly recomend.
Slow my phone down soooooo bad. Not a great app even if it didn't slow my phone down.
Dude put a lot of work into making profiles for an unbelievable number of cams. Worked right out the box, at least on my home wifi, hitting IP wifi cams and wired ones too. I use this in conjunction w a Zoneminder linux setup for home security and monitoring. Definitely gonna get the paid app when I get used to this new to me Android smartphone stuff. That said, any interest integrating this into zoneminder somehow ?
latest update breaks on desire hd 2.3.3. Keeps breaking/making connection to foscam.
Actually works even for freeway web cams here on perth wa. Be warned though your downloads will take a hammering with each use.
works before...but update the new version.... cannot connect to the IPCam again....pls check
Wish traffic cams were better... But this is cool I'm currently watching my university it is live and never lags lol
Great app , Perfect on EVO , Add "Rocketfish" cam support if possible, and I will buy the full version ... thanx !
Excellent app. When my camera didn't exist in the app the writer added it quickly.
Good camera app but it is a royal pain to have constant updates every couple of days.
I love this app. It lets me easily view my DLink cam on both my Droid phone and my android tablet.
I love this app this is fantastic we can see all traffic,beaches & collages wow i love this app
GKB PnP cameras has a cam ID instead of IP addresse. Should not be seted up :(
Does exactly what it says. I've tried others but their no where near as good. Worth the 5 bucks for no adds. Keep jp the good work.
Not bad. Like browser integration. Paid version not worth $US4.99, especially when there are *many* other similar apps around.
Viewing cameras works great on N1 but Record Mode still doesn't work. App description says that's part of this app but when I press record I get "Upgrade to unlock this feature!".
Works. Would like sound for Avermedia NV5000 system w/audio board. Video quality not so good.
I already bought it I'm using a Linksys (Cisco) WVC210 The best app in the market especially after that they enable the sound option
Amazing app! I think the cameras look better on my phone than on my computer. Best support around. Thanks for the hard work.
Neat app. However, the updates seem to be released about once every half hour. I suppose I shouldn't complain but, it does get a little annoying.
my ip cam cant sync with this sofware..using yawcam no luck. everthing done right just wont work
Works ok. But wouldn't uninstall though market. I had to use an uninstall app. Evo.
Great app - one of best ipcam apps in the market. Frequent useful updates. Needs motion detection for 5 stars.
Support for many IP cameras, has only 4 net cameras, If u don't have an IP cam, u don't need this app. I don't.
Great app!! I have foscams and I can hear audio so well, its amazing. Better than other apps!
Awsome app if u know how to use it,the maker of the app is a update machine,going to buy full version def. Worth the $
Works great with my Panasonic IP cams at my business! However zoom doesn't work with BL cameras
Awesome app! This app worked perfectly even after the app I got with my dvr stopped working. Droid2
I have a droid x app works great it stopped working after a few days It just has red downloading cameras. help!
Latest version prevents frequent image updates, which were possible with version 3.0.9 on Cisco WVC 210 network cams.
Don't not upgrade! All you will get is an add for two more cameras, that's it!
It just works! I have two cams at home and can always pull them up. Thank you!
Works perfectly with my HTC Wildfire and Edimax IP camera. Actually faster than the PC Explorer viewer
Lets me view my dog ip camera from work! So cool! Could be a little less laggy but other than that great! Droid X

We have this app on two captivate phones. Perfect on our two linksys types of cameras. Swipe to pan... Sweet!
Great when it works. Camera/Feed not available half the time even when I can access them through another app.
Like this app but recent upgrades make this app run in the background ALL the time. App killed and it comes back. BS. Potential spyware in app.
Great app to use when you're stuck in traffic! Had this app for 6mos and i continue to see cams added, even rural areas like mine.
It will not let you input private IP addresses. Some of us have VPNs, why limit us? Also, it appears to not have RTSP support.
I like it except that it constantly runs in the background. I don't use the widget so that is quite annoying.
Awesome! Working with my Q-see qsd9004 4cam dvr set up, not working with 16cam commercial qsc26416 but I haven't tried again lately. Thanks for app!!!
This is perfect for Q-See DVR, it shows 4 cams right on your screen! Simple configuration, small ads, I love it!
Works great with my Droid X and defender security cameras. Rob (author) was VERY helpful. I upgraded immediately and now have all 8 cameras on.
Works, but the ad is gigantic and overlayed on top of the image. Plus no audio with Linksys. Ill buy the full version once I can get audio.
Very nice app. The only minus is that it force closes very often (SE Xperia X10).
Love this app. A dream for a small business owner with different cameras to view.
Can someone tell me are the beach cams just still photos I have no movement can anyone help me please
For QSEE dvr you will ONLY be able to use port 18600. There is no way around.
Edit: New version has a work around using the stock browser. *This would be useful if it could get all the ODOT cameras in Oregon.
Works perfectly. However, it runs a process in the background even if you're not using the widget. Stupid...that's just sucking up resources.
It's like it supports every manufacturer but mine, Artnix. I'm dying for a reason to buy the full version and give it 5 stars.

i dont get it its the same as paid and you only get 4 on both :l still fun to show friends though :D
Works very well. Updates often but no big deal. Sometimes wonder what the updates are, a solid useful app though. Keep it up.

Fantastic app. Bought cheap nc 800 cam from ebay but couldn't see feed in browser due to active x. This app had it up and running on my n1 in seconds.
Works great on geovision 8.3 and 8.2. No adds on rooted Droid with ad blocker
Pretty cool. Medium learning curve. Far too expensive to jump to the paid version. Too bad.
Ok this app suks on the droid but good on ipod i dont get it
I can see the cam when im home. But not away frm hm. No res to Email. Need spprt

Couldn't connect to linux box serving a simple mjpg stream from motion; useless for me

Dont waste time downloading it its a waste of time and it dont work buy full version
Should get this to work on gettin on apple webcams that built onto the computers
This app is starting to lose my respect...after the update the cameras i had set up are now gone!
You just want everyone to pay for it now...uninstall
Wow... I requested to support my babycam with demo site provided. In a few days. My babycam is supported with pan and tilt control... Five star!!!
how do you use it ?! & it seems like a good app but just please explain how to use ..i`ll keep an eye on this app, but unistalling for now =/

Excellent aplication. Two things missing I think, more cam's and maybe choose between a password for each cam or one for all...

Nice tech
Good app
Exists under various names. Panning/tilt controls are upside down when camera mounted on ceeling, but you get used to it (Storage Options Cameras)
Set up was easy. even works better than the program the cameras came with.
Excellent app. Does lose image a lot and lots of flicker, but works. Widget is cool. Make smoother for 5 stars. Thanks
Ok, I originally rated this app 5 stars, but after experiencing compatibility issues, I have to reduce my rating :(  Let me be clear, this IS an AWESOME app. I am using the Samsung Galaxy S3 and I am experiencing issues accessing my cams (Camera / Feed Not Available). When this app was installed on my piece of crap Huawei Ascend it worked flawlessly. So has to be some sort of compatibility issues. Not sure if I should ding the Dev or the phone :)  Overall, I still salute the Dev... Great app!!
What happened to the widgets?  Gone after last updates Still like the app but widget was really nice!  Would be a 5 star if that was still available
Good but hacked!!!
Even though it's not listed as one of the supported devices, this app works fine with motion using generic HTTP type.  The UI is a bit clunky and it also seems unnecessary huge, otherwise would have merited 5 stars.
Absolutely love the app, works very well except on my newest camera and tbolt...Got the esky c5900...the camera does 22-28fps when i connect it threw wifi to my computer however it will only give 0.1 fps(yes thats right 1 frame every 10 seconds) when i connect to my tbolt...i no it isnt the cam due to simultanious viewing on both phone and comp...i dunno if its the app or just my phone being retarded...no support for my cam in the list but ptz does work if its an unknown model with make h6837wi(2) &no audio
Great camera. However, DCS-5222L is not on the list nor DCS-5220 series.
I have 2 Dlink DCS-930L and with mydlink i can only watch one at a time but with this app you can watch multiple cam and switching cam for full screen has no lag compare to mydlink  also no sound on this free app plus has ads but it don't bother me. I have yet to try outside my network if it works otherwise i'm just gonna use mydlink. Thanks Robert Chou.
Great software.
Well done. Please add support for motion on/off in Astak Mole.
It's great
works fine
works fine
Really a nice little app. I was surprised to see it even has the pan and tilt controls. Recommended.
Works fantastic with my D-link dcs-920 cameras. I even installed this on my wifes phone for a quick view of the yard.
Smooth n functional. Galaxy Tab
Very good :)
Please include LG security products models in your database.
Everytime i i turn my phone off it erases all my cameras and setting. Im getting tired of resetting all my settings its been doing it for atleast 6 months now.
Does what it says. No crashes or force close. DroidX2
Awsome app for free. Thanx!!!!!
Great thinking who make this app. Thanks lots its best.
Does not work with LG Android smart phone Can not find path
Now I can watch my home while away n it works wonders :-) worth upgrading 2 pro which Im doing. Thanks for the great app dev
Stop with all the updates!!! should find a different way to add new cameras. But Works great, developer responds to requests to add new devices.
How this App work? Can someone tell me please....
This is great, mine is the thialand beach!
Ok
Works great with my home security webcam. But updates every 3 or 4 days are worse than PS3 firmware updates!  I appreciate the developer support, but roll multiple updates into one, no more than once a month or so please!
Works very good on my Droid X. 5 STAR On This App. I like looking at the traffic from time to time.
Too many updates. Any chance of some lap-dancing bar feeds?   ;)

The only app. that works with  my cam. Thanks for your help, Mr Chou.
nice
Works very well.  I don't see an RTSP connection, but I might just be missing it.  Set up for HTTP motion JPEG and so far, flawless.  Will be buying the Pro version.
Would be nice if I could have a real full screen view
Would be nice if I could have a real full screen view
Works great with my 3 ebay ip cams just ads
Best camera app. Works well on everything...except Revues. Robert I will be purchasing as soon as it also works on the Revue. Unless it already does and I am just an idiot! Keep up the great work.

Excellent and very usable even with 6 cams limitations for free edition.
I really like this app
Works for me. I've got a foscam IP cam which I can log into using this software :-). Lots of updates tho'
Works very well.
Work great,stabile and fast depend of network,simple to use.Best regards from Dalmatia coast.
If only it could auto detect traffic cams ahead of your direction of travel.
Works well with EverFocus dvr. Wish I knew the difference between the basic, light and pro version. Anyone know the diff?
Goid
Works great when you follow instructions.. Took me a few times to get it to work but I finally went back step by step and can see my camera.

Been using for a while and has been great but latest version is keeping phone awake and draining battery
works great with both my DCS-900/930L IP came.
Love it
Anyone else notice the change log hasn't actually changed in a couple of versions? Otherwise, superior app.
Works great with my Foscam I8918W, easy set up. Pan not that great but ok (Hero). Best i've found til now.
Where is camera for Rutgers University?
Simply the best 3rd party IP camera software out there! Has a variety of supported cameras,if not contact the support team and they will add it.
La app es muy buena. Mucha variedad de cámaras pero los controles no son los mejores y la publicidad es muy pero muy molesta. Podria estar mejor.
Great app! Comes to the rescue since the geovision app does not work. Geovision should license an app from this guy! Excellent app. Excellent dev!
Please add Thailand Country to your support sell (Full Version I cannot buy it). I use Acer Iconia Tab A500 (Honeycomb 3.1). I work :). Also please support 16:9 (wide screen 1280 x 768 for my Device) It size not in ratio rate.
Great cm viewer.But needs to be able to play video playback in pro version. What good is recording if u cant view the vid...?
Had a problem but did a hard reset now its working again. Very nice app.
Works very well with my Night Owl system on my Epic Froyo. Free version is limited to 6 cams but that is good enough to see how well it works. 5*s
Great job. The only thing keeping it from five stars is the awkward UI when selecting cameras.
Its confusing if ya don't know wat ur doing but great to watch the cams and see the world without leaving ur house.
Slow my phone down soooooo bad. Not a great app even if it didn't slow my phone down.
Awesome program works great on my Zmodo cameras and keeps getting better with all the frequent updates that I went to the paid version .
Works great. Interface isn't the prettiest, but it definitely works as advertised.
Great app, too bad my feed stopped working after last update. Now usibg different app til update fixed....
It worked great but after recent update, the option for the widget no longer shows in wigget menue. Droid x running gingerbread.
I am using paid version. Video monitoring is fine but it does not record as a clip. And speaker Mic function is still inactive even after paying 5$
Great app.
Wish traffic cams were better... But this is cool I'm currently watching my university it is live and never lags lol
Works pretty good. Won't work on my cams, issue between password logon. And user name. TB 2.2.1
Awesome app. No sound on my Samsung Galaxy S from ACTi ACM-4001 security camera or others but I am hopeful. Good app for now. A0 V10
Chou. I updated today and it stopped working camera not available camera not available not available why.... Again update broke it. Trying again...
Great app . have a retail store works fine free is the best thing in the world
This application has allowed for me to view two different types of camera in NY from other countries, giving me peace of mind wile im away from home

This is the bestvapp out there !!! Would be nice if u can update from lite to pro from lite app
Pretty sweet app. I got my personal cameras guarding my house and now I can see my house without actually being there. Freaking NICE
I love this app this is fantastic we can see all traffic,beaches & collages wow i love this app
Its fun to see what goingon gota admitt just a little creepy someone could watch you and see u that clear but funny!
Hate the new icon if we have the lite version even if we have the activation code
GKB PnP cameras has a cam ID instead of IP addresse. Should not be seted up :(

People shouldn't give this app 1 star just because your to dumb to work it.5 stars great app!
Used to work great. Cams skip when loading n give feed not available message. Put back to where it was 2 months ago please for 5 stars again.
I like it I wish the refresh rates for faster, and the images were clearer.
Great on HTC HD2, but PTZ fails & presets greyed (Geovision DVR with 8.4 software). Help?

Viewing cameras works great on N1 but Record Mode still doesn't work. App description says that's part of this app but when I press record I get "Upgrade to unlock this feature!".
More than I expected. Droid X. Loftek CXS 2200 IP Webcam. Very easy config. I can view my webcam on my phone from anywhere.
I use it instead of my GPS to see traffic on the high 5 in Dallas everyday. Great app. HTC evo
Best app. Love the new record feature but please make it so that you can play back in video mode instead of pictures. Thanks. HTC Evo
Great app and very well supported by Robert Chou. Tried several apps. This the most reliable & easiest. Droid2 and ABS Megacam
good apps and works fine with my ipcam at home, not complicated as long as you have ipcam url ready for set up.
Tried the free trial and had to purchase. Gets updated constantly for new features. This app well worth buying.
I already bought it I'm using a Linksys (Cisco) WVC210 The best app in the market especially after that they enable the sound option

Neat app. However, the updates seem to be released about once every half hour. I suppose I shouldn't complain but, it does get a little annoying.

Works great in wifi mode! Even though I have my cam setup to be viewed externally via a dns server, I have yet to get it to work in 3g-LG Optimus S
If you could make a version that's supports the NVR Milestone System you would be a very happy person relaxing on white sandy beaches.
Great app - one of best ipcam apps in the market. Frequent useful updates. Needs motion detection for 5 stars.
Stopped working on my phone 2 updates ago. was great to check into home cam to check up on family. love the pan and tilt controls. downloaded another cam viewer not as good but it is working. still have this one loaded will keep updating. hope it comes back up.
Works great on Droid X. Now I check the traffic cam at the on ramp before leaving work. Also can check the security cameras at my house from my phone
Great app, works with Bosch ndc 25x. Maybe this is a limitation of the free version passwords don't work.
Testing this on LG Optimus V. 4 to 6 home cams w/ no name dvr. GREAT interface. Few loading probs. Bad reviews are ignorant. Learn your system.
Nice apps but still hard to use on my X8. But Still can see the main highway.
It uses huge amount of data even when it is not active. Check it with a net counter. The question is why? Suspicious?
Great app. Audio seems to have stopped working and makes the app unstable especially for my airlink 500 and 747 cameras
Its very good! But my edimmax camera is mounted upside down, I flip the image via web page control, but not this app. lucky the phone can be turned!
Nice app. Would like higher quality med. widget because now it is so blurry it is useless. Small size is decent.
Works for viewing my Defender SN500 security system pretty well. Would love to view a live stream from my cameras.
if you have internet cameras just buy this application without delay I have 8 cameras and it is slicker than anything I have come across to date
Really i as very good app. Ads are intrusive, but it's free! Would prefer better image quality.

I found it to be slow. Installation of cameras was easy. Gui is terrible. Liked the widgets.

A great app I have tried several and this is the only one I could get to work with droid
Works great as a baby monitor using a IP Foscam. Pan and tilt glitches but does what I need. Streaming video from the Internet works great.
Great app! Now just give me sound on my Astak Mole and I'll happily buy the app.
A great app i love it! I have not found out how to look around my local arera thow :( but the rest is a okay! :)
Worked on first try with my D-Link 6620g, awesome, have spent an hour looking for an iPhone version, need to make an iPhone version!!
Ive purchased 4 app for my ip foscam,but this one is the best and the only that support audio,no problems at all,need improvement to audio.
Such a great app, always updated with new cameras and dvr's. Out of all the apps I have on my evo I think I use this one the most.

Works well on my DX viewing my two Panasonic webcams. Why are there so many updates?
Pretty cool,can it do cams in buildings,and or live real time.and where can i get more ip,s for cams in my area?
Lets me view my dog ip camera from work! So cool! Could be a little less laggy but other than that great! Droid X
Very impressive. 4 stars do to only preloaded cams being live feeds. Prob need to buy full version to get live feed on your setup. Great job though.
Cool app, works great, needs a little getting used to configuration, but then runs fine!
I'm really impressed. I can view all my home foscams and control them by dragging the view across the screen. This is a slick piece of software.
i thought that this app was going to let u choose a nearby camera- it says that i selected japan when i cant even select!
I'm giving it a lot of stars because it good. But I'm uninstalling it because its creepy. When I use this I feel like a creep for watching.
Probably the best app I have installed on my Galaxy S 2.2. Definitely one of the most useful. Didn't even need the paid version but got it anyway!
It worked at first but then it wouldnt let me back in to view the cameras. It said i would have to purchase the full verison to view the web cams

Good app. Will prob buy paid version to get rid of ads and get sound working. FYI, gestural pan/tilt seems to be broken in 3.5.3 or so...
Now the pan button causes a w i d e. Sweep. Can't slightly move it. Arghh
I found this apparently don't know where? But itworks really works well with one exception. Can't figure out how the PTZ works. Are there any instruc
This is by far, the best app for viewing my security cameras. I will definitely buy the full version. Very impressed with all the updates. Htc evo.
works great on my n1. btw how to reduce refresh time of the screen camera.
Works really well. Was a breeze to setup my wvc54gca and a couple webcamxp boxes. Planning to buy the full version soon. Thanks Robert!
Great app! Love using it to show off my phone! Lol cant wait to hook up my own wireless ip cams at home! Moto-droid 2.2 froyo

Works great with my Axis cam ! Widget stops working at every update. Have to open the app to accept the changelog, and then it's fine. Annoying..
Watz up wit thizz. Iam in kali. not in japan. I wana c da BAY AREA
Not work in the UK?? I don't understand y this app was made! Is this real? Can ppl c these cameras? However I find it very intriguing :)
This program is worth every penny!! I have some cheap dlink dcs-920 IP cams, and this program displays the video feed flawlessly. A++

This app in general is awesome and the quality is good. I gave 4 stars b/c ver 3.2.1 doesnt work. Good thing i had 3.2.0 backed up w/ App Monster.
Best app for android. I use it to do traffic in morning and after work. Then use it as a baby monitor for my 2 boys! Purchased ipcam from ebay for $60
Great app...adverts a smidge too invasive... or 5 stars. Will purchase when fully supports all streams of compro ip70 (inc audio)
Works great with my linksys camera. Needs option to move too SD card on 2.2

Great app, thx for adding LTS to the long list of supported DVRs and cams!
Yes I have everfocus can we please get some more support for the everfocus applet 1.4 to be specific. also do you add "http://" to ip adress
Cool app! Works good on moto droid. Needs the ability to rotate the cam view 90 and 180 degrees for ceiling mounted cams.
Awesome! Working with my Q-see qsd9004 4cam dvr set up, not working with 16cam commercial qsc26416 but I haven't tried again lately. Thanks for app!!!

Good application! Would be even better if it was possible to control the brightness on the cameras.
Does what it says it will do. Good picture quality. Pretty easy to control. Works great with my panasonic cameras and droid.
Great work and still free and works great. Always use to monitor my home with airlink IP camera while away from home.
This is perfect for Q-See DVR, it shows 4 cams right on your screen! Simple configuration, small ads, I love it!
Works good with my qsee but there is a 3 to 5 second delay in the feed would pay if that can be fixed but other then that great app
Works great with my foscam. I can watch the baby sleeping from the other room.
Nevermind must have been user error. Love this app. Been showing it off to everyone at work.
Purchased and used daily for home webcam viewing, reliable and full-featured when using Panasonic cameras. Makes me want to buy more cameras!
Wish I did not have to see ads without paying for this. Needs a better UI before I would consider buying the paid version.
Love this app. A dream for a small business owner with different cameras to view.
Can someone tell me are the beach cams just still photos I have no movement can anyone help me please
Great App. Categories make it easy to view the beaches while I'm at work dreaming about our vacation.
Great app I will buy when get paid badass could u add a button to turn on led airlink aicap650w
N1 - Have yet to get IP cam added I can see. Getting sick & tired of subpar android apps!
It's like it supports every manufacturer but mine, Artnix. I'm dying for a reason to buy the full version and give it 5 stars.

Great app and very useful, but the updates every few days are maddening. What's up with all the updates?
Good functionality. Running shop cam & home cam. Nice work, but a little costly ($) IMO.

great app, does what it says pretty well. Works with megapixel axis cams too. Developer is very responsive, great customer support.
Super clean. Love it - worked the 2nd time I tried to set it up. I wasn't typing URL in correct spot. :-)
I use Video Server on my computer to view my cams. The brand of the system is Dimerge. This app won't connect.
$5 is a bit high for paid version. Would like a cheaper no-ad version, maybe $ .99 for single-cam, no-ad.
This is a great app. Can't get it to work with cams at hotel. We use a 16 channel dvr and remote viewer in windows. Help
Use it to keep an eye out on employees. 5stars if a way to connect it to computer/usb TV, or recordable on sd card
Girlfriend hate it (cam is in the bedroom). I love it because I Cam watch my dog.
This app is amazing! I love being able to monitor my house from anywhere i can get a signal.
Great performance! Working smoothly, definitly worth a purchase for full app! All my cams work. 5 stars***** sweet update! Love the new features!!!
I'd buy this app if the Market would let me, but New Zealand doesn't have access to paid apps. I've set it to show Auckland traffic cams. Cool!
This app is perfect for some research I'm doing. I wish there weren't so many updates.
Amazing... i just like to look at the example cameras and wonder where thats at. LoL
Couldn't connect to linux box serving a simple mjpg stream from motion; useless for me

Not only does it work great, but you can move the default cams with the trackball. Very cool.

I will glady pay for the paid version if you add preset control to Trendnet IP400
how do you use it ?! & it seems like a good app but just please explain how to use ..i`ll keep an eye on this app, but unistalling for now =/

Great app but need per camera u/n and pw. Also, any plans for pixord support?
I had this app when I had my blackberry. I loved it! It still needs work for Android, it isn't smooth. But I'm so happy you guys brought it over!
Gravy trying,,.m NC? C
Works great for me. Couldn't be happier. Even worked well for me over vodafone 3g network. Says more for the app than vodaphone. I am going to upgrade to the pro version asap. Hope it works as well as the free version.
Big t cam
This is a must have!
No longer compatible with the Nexus 7 :-(

I'm using this to view live video feeds from the IP cameras (Aztech WIPC302) installed at my home, over my HTC Sensation. Even though "Aztech" was not one of the manufacturers listed in the setup screen, I still managed to easily connect using the generic option.  The video feeds received are also smooth even though I'm running it over a regular 3.5G service in Singapore. Seamless experience so far . . .  will gladly recommend this piece of software!
Best app I've found for viewing the Logitech cameras.
Very good and fast!
Excellent app. Works with all cameras, even some very old ones.

This software gives an outstanding performance. I got this one after a long long long search in the market for a good software that can have a metrics view of cameras I want to monitor. This software gives you an amazing view of cameras with out having delay in the video.   easy to use,video  recording facility, direct cam access from home screen through cam widget are the other highlights. And so on.. Thank you for the team
I have a Samsung video system in home for security. This works flawlessly with the four cameras. Far better than the original web based system. Upgr
Amazing
Perfect app....
Great job on this app.   Works every time and was easy to set up.
Bought a cheapo camera from Amazon. Forwarded the ports, job done!
I've downloaded many similar apps and this is the best. What's important is it supports many different brands and models, it has ptz ability by swiping across the screen, preset position, snapshot and recording.
Dis is true is dosnt work and it works lol
Really good for my galaxy pro!!!
Really good for my galaxy pro!!!

I used to think "TinyCam" was good. But, this app does more, including snaping a picture on the fly!
Loveeeeeeee it!!!! :)))))
Great app!
Use tiny can - works and well designed and planned. This app isn't well thought through.
Great app, access cameras locally or remotely. Clear pictures, great matrix view.
Very good work..

Even though it's not listed as one of the supported devices, this app works fine with motion using generic HTTP type.  The UI is a bit clunky and it also seems unnecessary huge, otherwise would have merited 5 stars.
I upgraded to the pro version, to support the author and enable the additional features (2 way audio). This app does everything you could want it to do. Highly recommended. Using this for my Foscams (8910w, 8918w) and Q-see DVR system.
or is this is fun and funny to watch people
i like it
Idk if it's my phone, but I can't connect when using 3g, only wifi:/  otherwise it's better than the app that came with our security system
App is awesome. Use this for multiple clients and it works flawlessly. Buy the full app. Its cheap. Also don't understand why people complain that it doesn't work. Try setting it up right. Works 100% of the time. EVEN USING PUBLIC IP ON LAN WIFI!!! AWESOME!

Lull '               Aeow
Works great......one of the best things I've got on my phone......
High quality video streaming with multiple cams viewable at once make this app top notch.
This is a beautiful program, a bit complicated to set up but once you got it it will go perfectly,thanks Robert Chou
Works great on my HTC EVO 3D. I can see all my cameras very clearly.
Easy to install, set up and use.
I didn't need the extra camera functions of the paid version but bought it anyway just out of appreciation for the developer.
Good
Working great, had reformatted my tablet and the app reverted to non-paid version so I emailed Mr Chop and got me fixed up again. Well worth paying for. Thanks again!
wish there was a way to load this app  on   a pc version of chrome  my hotel im at has  ratty   wifi and  works better on my  pc  than the wifi on my  mytouch q
For days now i have not gotten any feeds. Fix
I've been using this app for over a year and its the best ever.  Developer recently added sound which made it even better.
Worst experience. Not connecting.
This is simply the best IP Camera app and frequent updates keeps it the best.  While the Free version works fine, the paid version helps support the developer and adds incentive for new and better apps.
No audio
Old Samsung 1040k dvr & swann dvr both running( Samsung doesn't even support that model
I used this app for a year free and found it to be very reliable. I've since paid for the app and believe it is good value for the features that are in it. I have 1 IP CAM and 3 cams off a DVR. All are running fine and have no problem connecting to them from Hong Kong to UK. Definitely recommended. Also recommend paying to release from the advertising to get the full advantage of a clear screen.
Hard to work
This a great app, many manufacturers already available, really easy to setup, follow instructions on website and you'll be viewing your cams in no time at all. I installed the app that came with system, very hard to setup, poor video quality, not IP Cam Lite. Better all the way, I will soon upgrade. Thanks for an excellant app.
It's great
works fine
Thanks great app
Thanks great app
Great!
Really a nice little app. I was surprised to see it even has the pan and tilt controls. Recommended.
Wow
Has been working perfectly for several months now. Never a glitch or an issue. Thank you Robert Chou for a stable and bug-free app!
Nice really works

After trying at least 25 other DVR viewers, none-of-which worked, the IP Cam Viewer Lite app worked the first time it was loaded and activated. (Samsung Galaxy S+, GT-I9001, os2.3.5) There is still the issue of accessing in the real world, outside of one's LAN, but that is another problem unrelated to the app. It would be helpful to have more detailed instructions on using ddns. Congratulations on a very good app.

Works perfectly with my D-Link cam. So convenient to be able to access the cam from my phone and tablet! Going to buy the paid version right now.
I connect to Foscam and Axis brand cameras with no problem. PTZ controls work like a charm for both. Great job Robert!
Excellent free app. Shouldnt be free for what you get! TOP STUFF.
Does what it says. No crashes or force close. DroidX2
Excellent, does the job, connects to several different camera manufacturers I use. I have it on multiple devices and recommended it to our alarm and camera fitter for his tablet over the suppliers iPhone app. Now he can see many cams from 1 app.pan tilt speaker microphone record, image and or controls invert. Good work. Also it is worth going pro and give Robert a few quid for the trouble
No problems encountered, useful free app.
Great
I have it showing live feeds of my two Panasonic pet cams.
Brilliant. ...does what it says on the tin so to say.... Avoid the auto update though as i have to reset my ip address again.... Which i dont have to do if i manually installl...wierd but easy with. Tweaking...love it
Work like a charm..
I had 2 scan to find my dvr and after that everything work just great
Only android app to work with Winbook DVR cameras from microcenter.
5 diff d-link cams, installation a breeze. This made my galaxy pad value for money. Will go for the paid version
This app works great from private security cameras to public traffic cams. Very flexible and worth the few dollars to upgrade.
Worka perfect. Love it. Ptz controla work nice too
Best cam ever

Lol its awsomee
This little program works with more cameras, encoders, and video management system than most commercially available video management systems costing thousands of dollars.  Keep up the good work, and keep the updates coming.  New devices are released all the time so it's nice to get the updates regardless of the frequency.  Don't listen to the comment regarding making less frequent updates.  It's not like he or she has to manually update the program.
Great app. Works well with my Panasonic cam on my LTE Galaxy Nexus. Interface could use some refinement.
Omg...get a life dear developer..I love your software..works the way I wanted..but can you make it once a month or twice...god bless u
I don't think the author has a wife ;-) The program is updated with a high frequency. It even supports the Ubiquiti airview camera. I do not know how the author has done that, but I am certainly impressed! The only point of criticism: the icons are a bit old-school.
Works perfectly. Thank you!
Simply the best - a must-have if you own a CCTV dvr  This from someone who designs dvr hardware for a living Wish it supported archive access, but i understand the limitations

Stop with all the updates!!! should find a different way to add new cameras. But Works great, developer responds to requests to add new devices.
This app has help me get my delivery route done way faster. Just check where your headed for traffic.
No traffic cams working in Hawaii
How this App work? Can someone tell me please....
Works just like it says.....going to put the pro version on my tablet!!
Great app. Use it every morning to check my traffic route for work on the highway cams!
This is great, mine is the thialand beach!
Ok
Awesome
No issues on HTC Evo 3D
Works well on ICS.  Very smooth and easy to use. Excellent.
I have no experience with ip cams or sim software, but it took me under 5 minutes to get the image:)
Great smooth app... Free too
Great smooth app... Free too
This is a wonderful app however just not for me. I like how u can view multiple traffic cameras but that's is all I would use it for. Still a 4-5 star app - DROID 3
nice and well program. work great with old Grandec IP III camera. 5 stars from me.
One the best programs available to droid.
Works great for hawkings HNC210 wired cam
Funktioniert sehr gut mit einem DVR von PEARL. Mit Hilfe des "Scan Camera" hat es mehrere Kompatible gefunden!
This app, and, NetEye, appear to be the same app, right down to the screen layouts, buttons, and options.  Okay... who copied who?  I would like to know who not to give my $4 too.  The NetZEye app even says their software is rebranded!!!, so it sounds to me that this is the original?    There are a few differences.  One is being able to purchase the Pro version in Android market -  for that very reason I would be more likely to purchase IP Cam Vewer Pro.    Here's a comment I posted for NetEye before I found this app!  Since they're virtually identical, I'll post it here for fairness(ery)....      Outstanding app. My logitech is inverted tilt, and the Foscam has inverted pan (not the apps fault). App has options take care of that and put the controls the way they should be. The only suggestions I have so far: (1) Have and 'Internal' and 'Extrernal' option (in the menu?) for the cameras Host/IP & port settings, so that one could easily switch from accessing the cameras from outside your network, to, accessing them from within your network. (2) Add an 'Exit' option.
Excellent app! I runs great on sgn/aokp
Too many updates. Any chance of some lap-dancing bar feeds?   ;)
Request : Please add a screen lock button so that when I hit a key on the logitech revue it does not change the camera settings by accident.
Works with my old Geovision system which the Geovision app doesn't support.
Grt app
♥♥♥
This could be the absolute best cam/dvr viewer i tried. Highly recommended.
Nice app
What I need from a free software...
Couldn't ask for more
Best of all I tried for Android. Only app that has actually worked 100%. Works great w cameras from 4 dif suppliers, including 1 I couldn't ID. It went out and found it w scan funtion. Bought paid after free already worked w all cams. Worth it! Samsung Epic 4G Touch
Brilliant,  works perfectly with my IP cam in the children's room.
Very good app! Works well on my galaxy S.
Rarely cab you have actual access to the designer wheb havibg trouble. This man helped my small problem a complete pro.

Works great with my generic no name ebay cam ;)
Best camera app. Works well on everything...except Revues. Robert I will be purchasing as soon as it also works on the Revue. Unless it already does and I am just an idiot! Keep up the great work.
Excellent and very usable even with 6 cams limitations for free edition.
Great app
This software and the man behind it WORKS. Support is instant and its constantly improving.
I can view all 5 of my cameras at my house even simultaneously. Three cameras are IP and 2 are USB. I was able to use this software along with WebCamXP to get my USB cameras. Great App!!!
Thank you for a great App!
Thank you for a great App!
Awesome app, never fails or crashes on my Desire
Absolutely amazing piece of software. A true credit to the developer. Might require a little tech knowledge to set up but not a lot....no harder than setting up an IP camera out of the box. Highly recommended.
works great. Helps avoid traffic jams.
Very versatile app. Great to have when you need to look at a specific cam all the time.
Works very well.
Great
Works great on my HTC thunderbolt for my qsee cameras at work.
it to see road conditions. Awesome.
Easy to configure and use.

So far so good, found camera and is working, via wifi connections works fairly fast updates. A little slow over phone data connection but that is just my carrier . Phone is Samsung Infuse 2.2 (don't have the 2.3 yet)

Needs to support more airlink models so it's possible to view all vendor cams in 1 app- axis, airlink, etc- for homes & office clients. Uninstalling.
Works well with EverFocus dvr. Wish I knew the difference between the basic, light and pro version. Anyone know the diff?
Purchased! Well worth it! This is such an easy setup and works great. The UI could use a little polishing but it's not bad.
Thrilled with this app. We use with  a foscam in babys room its great.
Awesome!!
We use this for a baby monitor and it has been flawless.  Beats all the baby monitor systems.

My dvr is supposed to be compatible with Android. Nothing else has worked, including the bundled software. This works perfectly, even though the market says its not compatible with my phone. (Huawei Ascend). I couldn't even find an app for my Ipod touch that worked.

Works great when you follow instructions.. Took me a few times to get it to work but I finally went back step by step and can see my camera.
App worked on my ATT Inspire since day 1
Video works but free version has no audio, so it's useless for me as a baby monitor app. Would never buy pro w/o being able to test audio.
Just purchased, works great, thank you.
Been using for a while and has been great but latest version is keeping phone awake and draining battery

Works with Q-SEE and Swann cameras on XOOM with honeycomb 3.2 update. Swannnview didn't work after update of os, but this does. SuperCam gets some FCs, but works. This program is better, at least on XOOM wifi with 3.2.
Grasias funciona bien en monterrey y las camaras de mi casa la pro esta mejor sigue asiendo cosas asi y las seguire comprando

Dude put a lot of work into making profiles for an unbelievable number of cams. Worked right out the box, at least on my home wifi, hitting IP wifi cams and wired ones too. I use this in conjunction w a Zoneminder linux setup for home security and monitoring. Definitely gonna get the paid app when I get used to this new to me Android smartphone stuff. That said, any interest integrating this into zoneminder somehow ?

Does exactly what it says. I've tried others but their no where near as good. Worth the 5 bucks for no adds. Keep jp the good work.
HTC evo and kguard security cam and dvr set from newegg. Works great. Router with dns client built in helps. Wrt54g here.
Not bad. Like browser integration. Paid version not worth $US4.99, especially when there are *many* other similar apps around.
I have a Panasonic BL something camera and it works perfectly with a pretty good image rate, you can tilt, zoom etc... it's amazing, I use it all the time to check my apartment when I'm on vacation. I don't know if it's possible to set up an alarm so that your phone beeps when it detects movement.
I like it I wish the refresh rates for faster, and the images were clearer.

Viewing cameras works great on N1 but Record Mode still doesn't work. App description says that's part of this app but when I press record I get "Upgrade to unlock this feature!".
More than I expected. Droid X. Loftek CXS 2200 IP Webcam. Very easy config. I can view my webcam on my phone from anywhere.

If I'd known this app was so fantastic, I'd have gladly paid twice the price. And Robert is always updating/upgrading the app to make improvements.
Very good and stable software, lots of features. Work great on my Edimax IC1500 devices.
It's so awesome. I can check my home security IP camera from anywhere on my evo. I can even pan & tilt to different locations too. Great app.
good apps and works fine with my ipcam at home, not complicated as long as you have ipcam url ready for set up.
Tried the free trial and had to purchase. Gets updated constantly for new features. This app well worth buying.
They sead it couldn't be done, not only it works it works great . I have over 20 cameras I watch on my droid 2 for both of my shops!! Very happy!!!!!

App is perfect and dev is perfect. He goes the extra mile to assist. Love the great options and widget. I run my weathercam on my home screen.
Neat app. However, the updates seem to be released about once every half hour. I suppose I shouldn't complain but, it does get a little annoying.

Besides being a fantastic app, I've never encountered an application that is supported so well.

Works great I have a Captivate and using a Foscam camera just went with pro version well worth the money keep up the good work.
I've had this less than 5 minutes and love it. Installing cctv at my business and wanted to check out the lite v.
Latest version prevents frequent image updates, which were possible with version 3.0.9 on Cisco WVC 210 network cams.
Don't not upgrade! All you will get is an add for two more cameras, that's it!

This app rocks, i can see traffic by my house, beach by bro in law in new zealand, where husband grew up in NY, sis college classroom! Samsung moment
Very impressive. 4 stars do to only preloaded cams being live feeds. Prob need to buy full version to get live feed on your setup. Great job though.
Why would anyone pay for this app when it works great for free. This app works great on my galaxy s
Very cool app! I love it. Works great on my LG Apex. Traffic cams work flawless. Thanks!

I'm really impressed. I can view all my home foscams and control them by dragging the view across the screen. This is a slick piece of software.

How can I say anything negative about this perfect app. Works perfect with my panasonic ip cam. Awesome and super fast.
This app is great. Can view traffic on major roads before I leave my house
Probably the best app I have installed on my Galaxy S 2.2. Definitely one of the most useful. Didn't even need the paid version but got it anyway!

Like this app but recent upgrades make this app run in the background ALL the time. App killed and it comes back. BS. Potential spyware in app.

Great app to use when you're stuck in traffic! Had this app for 6mos and i continue to see cams added, even rural areas like mine.
Just great on my HTC Desire 2.2. Planing to buy more cameras for my house and get full version.

Amazing! Well designed. Faster than the built in Java app that came with my IP camera.

Not work in the UK?? I don't understand y this app was made! Is this real? Can ppl c these cameras? However I find it very intriguing :)
This program is worth every penny!! I have some cheap dlink dcs-920 IP cams, and this program displays the video feed flawlessly. A++
The only app I could find that works for my zmodo based dvr/came that I bought from cctvhotdeals. Connects and displays all 4 cams perfect. This rocks

Best app for android. I use it to do traffic in morning and after work. Then use it as a baby monitor for my 2 boys! Purchased ipcam from ebay for $60
Powerful and easy to use. The ability to see our dogs via our Linksys IP camera was the killer app that convinced my girlfriend to get a smartphone.

Works great with my Droid X and defender security cameras. Rob (author) was VERY helpful. I upgraded immediately and now have all 8 cameras on.
Works, but the ad is gigantic and overlayed on top of the image. Plus no audio with Linksys. Ill buy the full version once I can get audio.
Highly recommend! Viewing 32 cameras simultaneously. Author maintains and updates frequently. Awesome!

Great app and very useful, but the updates every few days are maddening. What's up with all the updates?
Good functionality. Running shop cam & home cam. Nice work, but a little costly ($) IMO.
I can't believe this app has webcam xp. I put in my ip, username and password and it worked perfectly. This has become my most used app. Thanks.

Had setup problems: my phone auto-added a space to the url before the IP. Finally spotted it & corrected. Works well on Dlink dcs-900w.

Worked perfectly with my geovision setup. Much better than their own app for winmo or blackberry. Robert is also very helpful when you have issues.
This is quality SW. I see exclnt images on my wcv80n using http on my droid. Forget rtsp.
Super clean. Love it - worked the 2nd time I tried to set it up. I wasn't typing URL in correct spot. :-)
You no idea how long I've been looking for something like this. Once the ports were set on my router it works great on my Motor Driod & Linksys WVC80N
Great app! Clients are amazed when I show them their camers on my phone. Very easy setup. One of my top 10 apps.
I use Video Server on my computer to view my cams. The brand of the system is Dimerge. This app won't connect.

Wow, great cust service... if you have probs or need different traffic cams, go to forumn.
Works great, no problems. Linksys is a great default setting if you don't know the camera type
Works perfectly with my Panasonic. Slide my finger on the screen and the cam at home moves.

$5 is a bit high for paid version. Would like a cheaper no-ad version, maybe $ .99 for single-cam, no-ad.

Wow. Works so good with my cam & various traffic cams that I might just buy the full version.
awesome! i thought i needed flash to have the video stream of our new born on my phone.
One of my favorite apps. If you have a webcam even an old one this thing works.
Use it to keep an eye out on employees. 5stars if a way to connect it to computer/usb TV, or recordable on sd card
Works amazingly well with my Panasonic cameras. Picture is crystal clear. Image loads fast, much faster than it loads on my computer. Motion is smooth

Absolutely phenomenal! This Dev deserves a 5 from everyone. If a bug surfaces email him, don't give less stars
This app is amazing! I love being able to monitor my house from anywhere i can get a signal.
FaNFriGGiNTaSTiC!! The kids are scared to death. I just wish people wouldnt rate low because of user ignorance and updts. Updts mean the devs care!
Great app if you buy the full version very worth it for grid view makes me feel like im working at the traffic place

Couldn't connect to linux box serving a simple mjpg stream from motion; useless for me
Rob is the man and this is one of the best apps available in the market. Clean easy to use GUI. Support this app and buy full version. They earned it!

Didn't work with my camera, emailed devolper and it was updated almost immediately!  Great job and thanks!
Better than sliced bread! This is definitely a 5 star app if you have a compatable camera.  Panasonic BL-C131A is real sweet & fairly easy to set up.
From what im seeing everytime an update happens people lose their cams..dont update it anymore
Developer was very fast adding support for y-cam afer giving demo site with camera image.
This app is starting to lose my respect...after the update the cameras i had set up are now gone!
You just want everyone to pay for it now...uninstall
Wow... I requested to support my babycam with demo site provided. In a few days. My babycam is supported with pan and tilt control... Five star!!!

Excellent w/ my linksys. Just wish it can stream faster than 1 frame/sec. Has great feature to view multiple cams. Easy setup. Thanks

Warning, the latest version downloads and displays ads from unknown sources, uninstalling
Excellent aplication. Two things missing I think, more cam's and maybe choose between a password for each cam or one for all...
