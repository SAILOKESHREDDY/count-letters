This is a fantastic game for beginners and advanced players alike. As you play if you make a move that isn't statistically the best it'll give you the best option before proceeding.  It has option for jacks or better 10s or better and 3 others. The only thing I didn't like is the lettering "jacks or better " accross the deck I though it was quite annoying. Great app over all though.
