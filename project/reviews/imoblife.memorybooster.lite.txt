This is working NOW,their server was down,but its back up & running. I've used the app for 6mos,best app I have.
The advertisement crashes the program now, it works fine untill the ad pops up and then force close, plz plz plz fix
Memory Boost: Clears up some memory, for a couple of minutes. Program is taking up space. .....Droid
This app is horrible, it kept switching my phone to airplane mode no matter what I did. Un installed. Evo 4g
Dont install! Waist of time. Locks up phone and you loose signal strengh. Sometimes only a reboot will help. Deletes apps to.
Using this app has stopped my phone from constantly freezing up, works great. Use periodically! Moto Droid
May be force closing other programs after the quick boost command. I am running a flashed 2.1.1 but I don't think it's a firmware malfunction. X10a.
Every thing that would be even remotely helpful is only on the paid version. Why even bother with a free version?
Works great since the memory is so low even using move to sd card. This keeps what little memory u have from stacking up and slowing u down.good job
I just upgraded and.it is still telling me I need to upgrade to use all of the app or at least I paid for the upgrade and it is not upgraded yet
Its decent slowed down my samsung galaxy a bit. Two stars. Update it more frequently and five stars.
I have 2 evo, rooted and stock this apps makes both run faster when you have the whitelist set up right. No prob...pay version
I like this app. It frees a lot of memory but not for long... it drains battery. I added battery booster that sucked up memory. 3 stars!!
Cant tell if its working or not but i can not see any improvements so far. DROID 2
I tested the veracity of what is said about this program. Does not lower internal memory according to my phone.
Cut my # of active apps in half according to watchdog. That's good in my book. Less apps less power used (:
Cut my # of active apps in half according to watchdog. That's good in my book. Less apps less power used (:
Im not really sure what to make of it coz when Ikill apps and free up memory it slows down again 5 mins later wots this all about not sure how work!
Beware, task killer does not work on Android.  Can only recover small amount of memory worth auto boost.  Not worth it.
Freed 700+ Kb.. Using quick boost ... Uninstalled
Uninstalled what used to be a great app. But now it wants to read your location. Screw that.
Why does this app now  require the users coarse and fine gps location? It's a memory booster not a mapping or spying app. Uninstalling
Why does need GPS. So  stop ad BS just make good and clean program
No fast amelioration
This app was actually pretty good. I've been using it for about two years now, and recently it  hasn't been doing anything. I have the optimus and I now have to go in to settings and force close anything that I dont  want running. It might work on others phones but not mine. Until then one star.
It wouldn't kill map, phone, note and other programs that I installed in addition to pre-installed apps I'm not even using!  Would've -mailed developer before rating, but didn't see a link.  Very disappointed considering other's reviews.
Why do you need my location
Was really good but no reason to access my location. Too many permissions without justification, uninstalling..
DONT use task killers like this they will mess up your ram Android was made to run apps in the background its one of the whole points of android MULTITASKING!
I would have given 0 of wr could
Kill apps function destroyed my miui interface and user data, had to reflash zips and perform factory data reset...
Claims up to boost..... Ends up using 10MB RAM.... Selected processes restart after killing. Fails to do what the name says....1 star for the above average GUI.  On SE ARC S
Its just a task killer, which is already on your phone in task manager. The quick boost on recovers a rediculous ~200b but adds 8mb+ from the app opening. Useless, dont bother.
Nothing more than a big chunky task killer. Android comes with one you know.
It just kills apps. -_-
"Killed" apps still running. If it's not doing this it probably not doing anything else.
Excellent app just love it
.
free's up nothing at all. U se this app and i get less ram to use!?!?!  no value at all
Loved this app at first. After playing with it and killing tasks. And recovering memory. Or so I'm led to belive. Now I can't download any more apps. Msg file is invalid keeps poping up and failing to install. Hope I figure out this prob and hope its not related to this app because I want this app. 1 star till I solve this issue.  Uninstalled :(
I haven't got enough memory for a memory boosting app! :(
Installed fine but whem I try to load a rom the screen show the controlls for a second then goes to the main phone screen.... Like it wants to work but wont please help...
If you want another app taking up space on your phone this is for you that's all its good for
It downloaded fast and I did a quick boost, then killed 13apps  went from 85% to 72% that was short lived. Not a half second later my phone was right back to 85% killed the same apps back to back to back not doin nothin for my phone! Un install
Bs app
Does nothing unless you buy the paid version.
It dosen't work right at all, it just TAKES UP TOO MUCH SPACE !!! NEVER AGAIN.........  YUCK!
C'mon dev. How dumb are you to put ads in front of the buttons a user needs? Fix it moron!!
Apk invalid
This is just another task killer but has features you have to pay for. Why would I pay for somthing I can get free? I was looking for an app that defrags. This one says it does but it doesn't. It's just another task killer. For your missrepresentation I give you 1 star. Don't be shady, be upfront about what people really get and you will probably make more money. Nobody likes to pay a shady company to do shady business.
It sucks donkey balls
Its amazing ram booster in quick seconds
Preety muchh useless unless full version
Is an Awesome app that truly dose boost your memory up and gives you more space....I love it.
Installed on s2. Keeps forcing screen to go black and then need to reinstall battery...obviously removing.... Domnick
Not really good :-(
Doesn't work on galaxy nexus!! Please fix!!!
Got it, tried it, lost a couple of actions (scrolling up, selecting apps, and selecting Manage Apps) among others... Had to restart phone to uninstall... Quite a scare... Had this app for about 10 mins, if that... HTC Thunderbolt.
Only boosts memory for a few seconds. Inaccurate total RAM usage is meant to get you to buy full version. System info said I was using less than 50% but this said I was using over 80%. Clunky interface.
Works for a few mins then back to normal with clogged ram issues,sensations xe
Can't boost more than twice in ten mins other apps are way better
Fake app 
Increases free space for a few seconds thats it
After a min everythings the same as before
Seemed to work at first but after that it slowed everything on my phone down to a crawl. I had to restart phone and install it.
Garbage
Black screen on galaxy nexus
Didn't kill apps. Didn't boost ram.
All these apps wanting to access personal info like phone calls is rediculous and locking up our phones and slowing down our net. U dont need so much personal info. If u need it that bad then i dont need u
it keeps automatically adding the browser to the whitelist and wouldnt kill it. the whole concept of killing all unnecessary running apps with one click is ruined.
And takes awhile to load. Phone still bogs down a lot. Samsung intercept is probably why. :(
It's just a task killer, not recommended.
It's just a task killer, not recommended.
Apps still run after seconds of just "killing" them, and be careful if "select all" box is NOT checked at the "kill" screen..select which apps to do urself or it will kill everything selected..i'm uninstalling. Hope this was thorough enough to help..I dont usually give feedback..Razr XT19
Doesn't do anything!!!!!
Awesomeeeeee! Has every song I've searched for!
Doesn't defragment. Waste of space, but more importantly a waste of time. Works ok as an app killer.
Did nothing  to boost memory. Waste of time and doesn't allow to move to sd card.  Uninstalling
It does not save any. Uninstalling will give me more memory.
It force closes itself as well as most of my other apps on my galaxy 3
Doesn't do much but be a task killer and waste resources.
Maderchod,harami creater ..... Sala $2.99=158.5rs kya haram ka ata hai....only pro version is useful otherwise uselesss....
Im loosing memory from this
Don't know about app and I will change score after it starts working on my galaxy nexus
Wanted internal memory display
Space space in more space no.more looking
Terrible, all it is is an app killer. It will just kill very few apps. 1 app killed via quick boost, a few kilobytes saved and it says it's boosted...
Standard memory killer in samsung s2 does better job. Ran and stilk had 17 apps open. Wtf!

Kills apps and they are back running in 5 sec.  I want an app killer that keeps them killed until I'm really to use them again. Is there such an app
Task Killer>killed 7 apps. Home>Manage Apps>Running. Same apps "killed", still running w/ the TIME of run underneath. Seriously? You kidding me, man?
Cr*p. Apps reappear after exiting app+ checking again + other running apps didn't appear in list that appear in running services on phone. HTC desire.
Does nothing but use memory Uninstalling
Doesn't kill unwanted apps running completely! These stubborn apps pop back alive in a few seconds! Uninstalled.
Basically just a task killer, not an analysis of RAM usage.
Absolute garbage since last update. Even if the app is in the whitelist, it still kills it. Was very gd but no longer is.
Works
Sucks....!!!
Sucks....!!!
The update will not update or doesn't work.
It does what it says. Mytouch 4G.

Next to useless on android 2.2 or above. Freeing less than 100k each time. Try fmr memory cleaner instead
totally useless and highly misleading app. quickboost hardly increases free memory.totally misleading breakdown of free and occupied memory.
Didn't do much to keep tasks killed.
Doesn't do that much more than advanced task. Rather use that as its faster and ads seem less in the way.
Didn't boost any memory
It Really works and speeds up my phone. My touch 4g
Didn't see a difference in speed. Although if you want to see a difference in speed search and try "Fast Reboot".. it works wonders. Its the first one
Not worth using, I get more ram back using the task manager that already comes with my phone.. infuse 4G

<3 Love <3 this app ... but does it have an automatic calibration/auto-boost feature, if so... Where/How?

I use it from time to time but I still have yet to figure out what is mainly used for.
Absolutely phenomenal makes my battery last sooooo much longer can't wait to buy the full version WAY better than juice defender!!
Doesn't even show close to what memory I'm using comparing to my phones internal application usage.1 star. Quick boost did nothing... Uninstalled
Absolutely brilliant app, does as it says, and haven't had a developer go to the lengths that these guys did when I had a glitch, all sorted thx guys
Not updating because of SD removal. If you want widget, don't move to SD & quit being an rTard.
I texted them about the upgrade not being there & they said to upgrade. Lmao! Guess english is their 2nd language. I texted back. Text them.
Sick of it asking me if i want to update. When i press YES it doesn't. Uninstall onits way! Dont really notice any difference in performance anyway.
Works great! Ppl say some of the apps u close come back a min later. This is true but seems to b the case with all task killers. Batch close is nice.
Not worth a *#%* took up more ram then i had before i installed it
Installed and my phone slowed down to a crawl. Market app pictures wouldn't load, internet could barely load. Not recommended. Evo
Every time I kill a task it reopens in less than a minute. Every time.
Works fine on HTC Legend running 2.2 but messed up Incredible S running 2.2.1. Had to uninstall.
Wont be in my top bar when first turned on then good after -Droid x
Sorry to say this but this is just a task killer, not a RAM recovery tool.
It worked for awhile but then stopped after awhile. I was running low on space again.>:/
It is a scam! I upgraded and it didnt upgrade. Just paid for nothing. Do Not install!
It gives the impression that it free'd up space in the app itself,but if u go into ur phone settings,u'll see that nothing changed.uninstall.
Works great hate trial version full is the way to go when it comes to task killing beware what you kil can bug ur system and force you to restart smp

Rooted users should stick with AutoKiller Memory Optimizer, it is not this obstrusive...
Terrible! SS intercept. Crashed several times with in first hour, not accurate, drained full battery almost instantly
Using this app has stopped my phone from constantly freezing up, works great. Use periodically! Moto Droid
Screwed up my phone! Made all my programs force close and slowed down my phone big time. Good idea but horrible app!
Slows down my phone if it's not updated every 20 minutes and ever since I downloaded it...my phone shuts off all the time I dislike it
Very useful app...I bought the full version and the auto memory booster is absolutely critical...I no longer have to manually boost my phone

Where do you enter code once upgrade is purchased? Thanks for not sending me a note back, appreciate it...
Actually gave me more memory when installed. Motorola flipside btw which doesnt have lots of memory
This app is the shizzz love it fast like i like it does what it says it does no joke get it people good job guys
It's garbage. It drained my friggin' battery. Use Auto Taskiller to improve memory.
Might work like a champ if i pd for full version BUT as it is its a total waste of a d/l. Uninstall

Most options are disabled, asking for payment all the time. This is crippleware app with tactics like on windows. Uninstalled.
It dropped my battery17% on the install and drained it even faster when I tried to use a program see no use for this will uninstall in the morn
If you use this app plus advanced task killer you get the maximum use and productivity from your phone. Great job :)
During a call app cause screen to power down right away. Will not stay long enough to even enter voice code. Turning on powers screen on but only for
I really like it; it boosted my Droid 2s memory to 275 but right after downloaded it battery dropped to 60%..

Not sure if i benifitted from it as far as memory goes. Task killer doesnt leave selected tasks dead. Unistalled
Useless because in order to do anything you have to have the full version. The free one is stupid.
I want a refund. I just upgraded. Paid $2.99. And it now crashes and got nothing no upgrade.
I've had problems with proximity sensor and finally found this app. cause the problem. Uninstalled (Galaxy S)
I tested the veracity of what is said about this program. Does not lower internal memory according to my phone.
Works well on ZTE blade. Was sceptical at first but have to say it really seems to make a difference.
Its alrght... Works great the first couple of times, but after that it barley makes any room at all.

Not a good app doesn't really speed unless u buy uses underlying script that makes ur phone apds drain battery fail app
Its my 1st touchscreen n smartfone,and Im beginning 2 hate it.I have cricket new android fone.And the battery always dying on me.What can I do? HELP
Needs the ability to buy through market. This round about way is pathetic. Can't give better rating because of pre purchase unknowns.
Wish I could give it 0 stars absolute garbage, killed my data connection epic 4g
App is terrible and worthless on galaxy s and a friends droid x. Is Andy the dev or just pathetic?

Great app quick boost deff helps allowing more free space a click of one button
If u have a little of common sense, u know that Nothing boost memory on your phone. Unless u erase something.
Great app beings my available ram to 250mb's but wish it could keep above 200 and keep killing apps then 5 stars
Have been using this app for half a year. Never had a problem;-) thanx dev
Doesn't ever show open browser pages running under task kill. You have to pay via paypal for upgrade to get off of this lite version ugh...
It gets more memory by TAKING IT FROM YOUR MESSAGES! It took me a while to figure out why it was saying "Text message memory full". Plz dont get this!

Excellent program on my galaxy s. Worth upgrade to full version, and support staff are extremely helpful.
Works good but turns off sync. No full version on Marketplace to correct the issue. Uninstalled.
Very handy. Phone definitely less laggy. Put full version on market for 5 stars, please!
Need to be able to use other functions before buying a non market app! Who knows how or if it really works???
EVO, moved entire Droid menu bar into one corner of the screen. Removed all text from my app shortcuts.

I bought the full version for $2.99 and developer never sent me reg number. After 4 attempts at reaching them, I give up. Please save your money.
Every time I try to do something it prompts me to buy the registered version. Can't even test it. Uninstalled
Full version was worth buying actually evened out my Droid memory loss through the day
It would crash my fascinate every time I would make a call, had to do factory reset twice until I found out it was this app that was causing the crash
Hate it. The fact that it's always running actually slowed down my phone. Uninstalled.
Bare essentials. Forces you to purchase FULL VERSION. Minimal freeing up of RAM,don't bother!
Second time I did the memboost it hung the phone after it recovered eighty Meg. Uninstalled.
Very good application. Always room for improvment. Will buy full version when I get Defy. Made my Cliq XT work like new.
Do not do business with this company. I did NOT order the paid version and they charged me not once, but twice.
OK app.but fc after boost then phone goes black.has to re boot. Please fix.or why bother. Jdroid
works great with increasing available memory. can not turn off, runs continuously in the background and sucks the battery. uninstalled. HTC incredible
Useless! And tried to upgrade and after paying the money it gies NO OPTION TO UPGRADE. They stole my money. SCAM!!!!
The app makes my phone restart if they fix that then I would pay for it and would be a great app. Sprint HTC hero
Took my captivate from 115mb free to 210mb which was cool. But makes phone laggy sometimes. Uninstall

Felt like it helped on my droid but the droid x is another story... May even slow it down =/
Worked perfectly on my backflip, didn't crash my phone like the other comments said.
Seems to work but started to make my evo shut down on its own removed:(
Needs a no star rating. First time used boost it restarted my phone. Then went to options to change told me to upgrade damn joke if you ask me
Seemed good. But the memory it gives u just goes back down in like 10 mins. Uninstalled..

This apply kills other apps. But that is exactly what Android does automatically. Don't use t, You may lose data in other apps.
Works well on my evo. It saved over 100 mb of memory with one boost.

All it does is close unused apps, but closed a bunch i used and lost game progress. Uninstalled.
Never really saves memory, always having to boost, and then you quickly lose the memory you just gained back
Nagware, free version is pointless. And why the hell does it need permission to take pictures?!
Nagware, free version is pointless. And why the hell does it need permission to take pictures?!
Htc hero pr any other u have tp buy full version i uninstalled. It does nothing so get full and if u dont like get refund cuz u wont be able to try it
It simply kills other applications, same as task killers do. ....dun make fool of people pls
Terrible. Used more memory to run than anything else. Uninstalled right away. Rooted Droid.
Why make half an app ? I'm not paying to use the other half. Goodbye
Worst app I ever got. I tried to purchase it and of course they took my money with no product to show. And when I tried to get my money back. No luck.
Before the latest update it was a good apps with only limitation is auto activate of the apps. Now with whitelist added in, only way to select is pay
Functionality is very limited unless you buy full version. Not much difference on memory boost. Free memory is better, no limitations.

This is a great app, does exactly what it promotes and does it well yet I dont see the reason to add GPS locations in to your permissions especially without mentioning why in the "what's new" list. Justify and I will update. Simple. Until then I don't see the reason as mine works fine as it is.
The memory booster built in to NQ AntiVirus works better, without the 10 minute wait. Phone is a lot slower.  Uninstalled.
The app killer, killed 9 apps for about 10-seconds and then the app came right back on. And quit boost only gave me 506 bytes. I've only had this app for 5 minutes.
Not v good
Was great with gingerbread, does absolutely nothing after I got ics update .
Tried this for a few days, didnt seem to make any real difference in phone performance even though it would say it was reclaiming RAM. Biggest problem in my opinion is that i had auto boosting set to OFF and notifcations on... would get nonstop about it running without me telling it to. Aside from that, the apearence is rough and old school and the widgets are gaudy. Didnt seem to kill tasks as stated bc they would repopulate within seconds. Uninstall, not recomended
All task managers do the same as this app. The widget is ugly too!
Good
It was working fine until I updated the app. Now it's fore closing. Needs fixing.
Works same as a task killer, nothing great.
It works great!
My first-time to try this app so give Me time to inform u..
Doesn't perform its job well. Recovers next to no RAM whereas others will collect 100mb+
Good
Doesn't do well...still shows memory capacity low
It's just a task killer, not recommended.
Stil not sure how this works or if out works..  Will try to report back..  __samsung galaxy prevail
Doesn't defragment. Waste of space, but more importantly a waste of time. Works ok as an app killer.
Description says it only takes up 749 kb but after u dl it n go to manage apps it actually takes up 2.4 mb.
Never seems to free up more than 1kb, some of the other features are good though.
The update will not update or doesn't work.
NeverSmile...Its ok. I uninstalled.Didn't save my battery nor seem 2speed up my phone
Waste of time. Did nothing to free up my ram. Internal memoy is all it affects.
Doesn't do anything its cool looking but thats it wont close any apps just takes up space and slows the phone down Droid x
Didn't see a difference in speed. Although if you want to see a difference in speed search and try "Fast Reboot".. it works wonders. Its the first one
Decent, worked well, but messed with my shift's multitouch routines and had to be uninstalled.
Worked great for a while but after a few months starts to screw up my Incredible. It suddenly reboots and lags. Do not use this too often.
This is working NOW,their server was down,but its back up & running. I've used the app for 6mos,best app I have.

Mike x10 good app, but you have to buy the full version because the lite one does very little for my taste, get the android booster free is a 5 stars.
I love this app but hate that if you do a reset you have to buy it again sorry only 2 stars for that
Not updating cuz i dont need any korean expressions and want to keep it on sd card. Dont use widget anyways

Liked the app but one feature it didn't do was kill idle apps. apps I never opened were running like sprint nfl, navigator...
Didn't save me any RAM, nagged me to upgrade to the paid version, and had no way to exit.
It is a scam! I upgraded and it didnt upgrade. Just paid for nothing. Do Not install!

It was 5 stars until the update and to think I almost paid for it! Widgets stoped working!
The quick boost widget stopped working now after the update.. before it was a 5 star.. :(
RAM goes back to how it was before I 'boost' it. I used the task killer part as well but programs would come back and run in the background.
Why does this need to know my location i dont like that but its a good program so ill trust you

Doesn't work with most current update for the samsung fascinate. It'll mess with your display when malling calls.
No big boost on SGS Nero5. Features listed are almost all pd version, not this. Skirts AMkt fees w purchase via free mkt posts. Seems kinda slippery.
Very useful app...I bought the full version and the auto memory booster is absolutely critical...I no longer have to manually boost my phone

Its decent slowed down my samsung galaxy a bit. Two stars. Update it more frequently and five stars.
Its decent slowed down my samsung galaxy a bit. Two stars. Update it more frequently and five stars.
Just a task killer. Hero message low disk space. Deleted a lot of apps, & cleared data then this app told me I had less memory than before that!?
The only problem it drains my battery quickly. Other than that, it's a great app. My touch 3g!
Actually gave me more memory when installed. Motorola flipside btw which doesnt have lots of memory
This app is the shizzz love it fast like i like it does what it says it does no joke get it people good job guys
It dropped my battery17% on the install and drained it even faster when I tried to use a program see no use for this will uninstall in the morn
Looks convincing with the additional "memory boost" option but apps start back up shortly thereafter. Uninstalling.
DroidX: Free ver works, but drains battery faster than norm. Uninstalling... ATK works better on DroidX.
Useless because in order to do anything you have to have the full version. The free one is stupid.
Worked okay at first then started messing up my phone causing the screen to black out when it shouldn't. Samsung fascinate
Cant tell if its working or not but i can not see any improvements so far. DROID 2
Doesn't keep apps killed. Once u close optimizer the apps start again in the background..Droid X
I upgraded to latest free version, it optomized lesser than the last version Using galaxy3 android 2.1
Im not really sure what to make of it coz when Ikill apps and free up memory it slows down again 5 mins later wots this all about not sure how work!
Needs the ability to buy through market. This round about way is pathetic. Can't give better rating because of pre purchase unknowns.
It worked great, and did what it was suppose to. That was until I realized half my battery was being drained daily by this app. Had to unistall.
Awesome app. Keeps my memory optimized as much as possible at all times. Jane in CS rocks! Fast and efficient....Evo
Works good but turns off sync. No full version on Marketplace to correct the issue. Uninstalled.
Very handy. Phone definitely less laggy. Put full version on market for 5 stars, please!
Great app I use it every day and it helps saving battery and space. This should be installed on every android device!
TOO limited even for a free version.. great potential but im not going to pay for it.
Can't barely do anything with free version. All it does is kill all apps, I can do that with ASTRO!
Upgraded to full version as soon as I came across this and it works great. 5 stars :)
This is by far the best app I have ever found. The full version doubles as a task manager with auto kill option definitely worth the $2.99 for full.
Glorified task manager. Kills critical apps and requires payment for whitelisting them.
Most tasks it kills come right back. Every 10 min. cpu usage is the same.
Took my captivate from 115mb free to 210mb which was cool. But makes phone laggy sometimes. Uninstall
I also will not purchase this unless it can be done through the Android market, but app works fairly well. EVO 4G
Felt like it helped on my droid but the droid x is another story... May even slow it down =/
Why isn't the paid app in the store? Don't trust buying it from your website.
Never really saves memory, always having to boost, and then you quickly lose the memory you just gained back
Unnecessary bordering on counterproductive. RAM takes no time to clear, and uses the same amount of power whether it is in use or not.
Unnecessary bordering on counterproductive. RAM takes no time to clear, and uses the same amount of power whether it is in use or not.
Just another task killer but you have to pay for the white list feature. The UI is nice but otherwise crap!
Functionality is very limited unless you buy full version. Not much difference on memory boost. Free memory is better, no limitations.
Probably does work for most people, but just slowed the system down on my Droid.
…why does a memory optimisation app need access to my location, both coarse and fine? Not updating!
God knows
goood
I prefer system boost
Its just a task killer, which is already on your phone in task manager. The quick boost on recovers a rediculous ~200b but adds 8mb+ from the app opening. Useless, dont bother.
The UI is horrible and outdated. I would think a developer would take enough pride in there product to make it look decent. 3 stars for now, 5 when my idea is considered.
Do you any internet speed booster
"Killed" apps still running. If it's not doing this it probably not doing anything else.
This app works really well... But the widgets work like once then u gotta pull them off and put them back up before u can use em again... If fixed would rate 5 stars
there is no defrag, it's just another app killer... but you cannot shut it off.
It's ok. No auto booster in free version. Might as well manually clear ram using the cleaner on the phone
Seriously move the apps....geez!
I didn't realize any benefit.
it works on my phone
Please remove the ads, it's getting me annoyed.
Booster itself take 19 mb and little-little giving more memory. Full version maybe better
Uygulama androit 4 ile uyumsuz kesinlikle indirmeyin
When phone is slow and I run quick boost it doesn't seem to boost performance on ICS(4.0)
Way too much access to phone, removed.
It works well
It does allow you to reclaim memory,but not a lot on my Galaxy S 4g,why.Pls fix.
Y u getin so hapz its only a memory thing
Force close on my galaxy sII..ics 4.0.3 please fix it guys..then i'll give 5 stars
like all other task cleaner
Hhu
Wish there was a contact pic organizer
had google play active, tried to kill it with this app.  when I re-entered google play it was in the same place I had left it. to truly kill it I had to go to the settings and force close. how come no task killer apps can do this?
nice app..easy
Good
Makes my phone go faster, but it doesn't kill all my app which upsets me.
Very Good software
Very Good software
Made my rooted inspire faster than other managers, but killed my battery much quicker. 6 hr my phone is dead not using it. Day and a half with old.
Space space in more space no.more looking
Terrible, all it is is an app killer. It will just kill very few apps. 1 app killed via quick boost, a few kilobytes saved and it says it's boosted...
Still need to see a little more time with the app
I've compared to others after equal usage. Works but, does not stand out! DROID X
Works
Sucks....!!!
NeverSmile...Its ok. I uninstalled.Didn't save my battery nor seem 2speed up my phone
Great Job its perfect
This is an awesome application

Doesn't kill the apps, I go into settings and have to kill them again... htcevo
I use it from time to time but I still have yet to figure out what is mainly used for.
Mike x10 good app, but you have to buy the full version because the lite one does very little for my taste, get the android booster free is a 5 stars.

Not updating because of SD removal. If you want widget, don't move to SD & quit being an rTard.
I texted them about the upgrade not being there & they said to upgrade. Lmao! Guess english is their 2nd language. I texted back. Text them.
I won't update anything that doesn't tell what was changed or fixed. This app has yet to show that info. That's why only 3 stars from me.
Does the job, but keeps asking me to update when there is no update available. But it does to everyone.

App keeps asking if I want to update when i'm already updated to v3.0. Other than that, works fine on my Verizon Fascinate.

I like the new look of the latest update but...it Does also act a liitle slower, too. It sort of lags a little. Next update deserves speed
Works great, interface shrinks w lcd den, but no problems, black and white quick boost widget please

Has done everything I wanted it to! Have one problem (not with this app) but how do permanently delete other apps on Samsung Transform? I've tried b4
Not too impressed... Just a task manager, and programs re open a minute later. Galaxy vibrant.
For an apparently that claims to boost RAM AIT BARELY succeeds at doing that...I kill Alps and those exact ones I've just killed reopen In a matter of

Keeps dropping off the notification bar, used to be there all the time but now you have to keep going into the app manually to tell it to be there.
Keeps dropping off status bar, need to keep going in to setting to unable/enable. Please fix
Great app, best one on tje market so far. I have far less hiccups on the huawei ascend with the ram boost
It worked for awhile but then stopped after awhile. I was running low on space again.>:/
Doesn't allow you to quit app. You must have a separate task killer to stop the app from running in the background.
Works great hate trial version full is the way to go when it comes to task killing beware what you kil can bug ur system and force you to restart smp

Works good for motorola devour where the phone opens every app known and slows itself down... paid for it and never got the full version so dont bothe
The update sucks. I like last version better. I like app to sd though.2.2 Optimus S.
Doesn't launch after reboot. Need to go into settings & check "Show Notification Icon" after each reboot. Less efficient since last update. EVO
This is a great A1++++ App its works great on my telstra tablet with no issues at all. Apart from to upgrade you have to buy thru paypal. Lose a star.
Work as well as exspected still trying to figure it out so I can save more battery memory

Only 2 days sped up droid2 combined with batt booster this is very useful, stops freezes on phone
Force closed repeatedly. Really gay. Also U have to buy to get benefits. Uninstalling
Using this app has stopped my phone from constantly freezing up, works great. Use periodically! Moto Droid
Works great since the memory is so low even using move to sd card. This keeps what little memory u have from stacking up and slowing u down.good job
I just upgraded and.it is still telling me I need to upgrade to use all of the app or at least I paid for the upgrade and it is not upgraded yet

Got the full version. Works good if you keep it middle of the road. Further and I got some stability issues. Customer Service Rocks! (Samsung Capti)
A quick boost would disable some necessary services like my hourly chime. Uninstalled. Better let Android manage the RAM.

I like this app. It frees a lot of memory but not for long... it drains battery. I added battery booster that sucked up memory. 3 stars!!
Not sure if i benifitted from it as far as memory goes. Task killer doesnt leave selected tasks dead. Unistalled
Useless because in order to do anything you have to have the full version. The free one is stupid.
App worked pretty good. Didn't drain the battery much.but did make my fone freeze . Optomus s.

Cant tell if its working or not but i can not see any improvements so far. DROID 2
Another software : automatic task killer, it can do clean memory in an easy way. Hope I could see how much space a process occupy in current memory
Just reminds me of how little memory the phone has and how much crap i need to get rid of. Sort of depressing. Saw no change regarding battery usage.
App works great, phone runs a bit smoother. BUT it kills you battery. Droid x
Tried it because it not only boosts memory / ram but it said it manages apps ... disappointed again because you have to do it manually unless you pay
I tested the veracity of what is said about this program. Does not lower internal memory according to my phone.
There's better apps out there to kill apps and free memory. Use advanced task killer instead.
Its alrght... Works great the first couple of times, but after that it barley makes any room at all.

The app is amazing and the support help is amazing as well will continue to do business with them again merry Xmas ;-)
Works great but really don't need it for Droid X. Doesn't drain battery that's good.
Helps me turn off things that turn on all the time, uses a lot of battery power, i can delete apps, erase history, and tms and its same memory used!
I bought the paid version and have it set up so it keeps my memory at a good level all the time. In addition, the customer support are really great.
It did boost my memory. I didnt see an actual change in performance (other than benchmark test) bcuz my galaxy S phone has always been quick & speedy.
Awesome app. Keeps my memory optimized as much as possible at all times. Jane in CS rocks! Fast and efficient....Evo
it was great until it deleted itself. now it just force closes everytime i try and reopen it.
Loved the free version. Paid for pro version and wish I didn't because the free version isn't any different. Exact same in every way possible.
It gets more memory by TAKING IT FROM YOUR MESSAGES! It took me a while to figure out why it was saying "Text message memory full". Plz dont get this!
Works good but turns off sync. No full version on Marketplace to correct the issue. Uninstalled.

Might be a fluke , however after downloading this into my facinate my phone went crazy, it began to lag & freeze. As I stated, could be a fluke.

Bare essentials. Forces you to purchase FULL VERSION. Minimal freeing up of RAM,don't bother!

LG gt540 worked like a treat. Like to see more detail of what's been removed.
Works great, but noticed bluetooth issue after boosting. While on call I couldnt switch from speaker phone to private call.
This program, along with Advance Task Killer, will keep your phone running smooth and at max speed!
Boosted way more B4 last update. Now when I boost I get like 650kb, before it was more like 10MB! Smsng galaxy
Actually it makes my battery life lasts longer michael..This app works far better than atk. Very functional and smart.
Freed tons of RAM but wouldn't let backflip boot. Be careful with this one. Can only change kill level on paid version.
Do not do business with this company. I did NOT order the paid version and they charged me not once, but twice.
Great app for lower end android phones. Pay app worth the $3 Blaze running 1.6
I also will not purchase this unless it can be done through the Android market, but app works fairly well. EVO 4G
Felt like it helped on my droid but the droid x is another story... May even slow it down =/
not bad but can get free apps that that do more for task management. Uninstall
Seems to do ok but the whitelist option don't work it keeps force closing wish it would work. Droid eris
I like it but when i try to upgrade, my information keeps deleting before I can process payment :(
Unnecessary bordering on counterproductive. RAM takes no time to clear, and uses the same amount of power whether it is in use or not.
Forces HTC Hero to boot, going to uninstall. If this bug gets fixed, it would deserve higher rating & re-install.
When tapping the whitelist, it fc's and restarts the os, motorola droid, other than that it does work, fix the fc and reboot ill buy it

It working grat on my Galaxy Note. Still room for improvement. That's why I leave another star blank.
Cool
Works great...try it...
Does what it's supposed to. I'd give it a 5 if they would remove the stupid nagging confirmation screen when you exit.
Works
can't clean ram properly
Really helps!
Its easy to use an great app! Kills apps too! An shows free an used space.
Works great, and easy on the battery.
Good 1
Thanks for add our language.
Love it
Does what it's supposed to do good app
Coool app..
Mine does not have most of the options? And I paid. :-(
Nice app
Helpd me a lot
Cooll
A good app for speed
Work likes charm.
Great..
Yet to examine '
It works better, but after the update the widgets look hideous and I had to hide them now. I'll give 4 starts cuz of that.
.
However, that widget sometimes will hang.
Thums up...!!
It really a great app.try it
Does not do as advertised. I had to do a monologue today and totally forgot the whole thing because  my memory was not boosted. Hopefully next update will fix this issue.
Good aap
Generaly the app is great but the widgets will either superlag or just won't work most times on my SE xperia neo v
Good
Galaxy S Aigo..... It really does show me its awesome working... Before using this app i couldnt free RAM memory so much but now using it i mostly get 260mb free  0f 490 Only lacking thing is its widget while being on home screen somtimes doesnt work.... So i gave 4stars.
No
If it works like the1st run a must have
it's koo. Ma memory was recovered on ma fone that I needed Its an. Excellent source! !!
Can be improved, bit slow in response
Wish I had known about this app sooner, really helps me boost my phone memory which had become a right pain. Only four stars due to not being able to store it on the SD card!

This is what i was talking about

The widget doesn't work sometimes on galaxy s..pls fix.
Black screen on ice cream sandwich ROM on DROID RAZR. But has worked for me since I had my DROID X with 2.1 eclair.
Does the job
Fosho doe I can work wit it
nice app
Really works was nicely surprised how it boost my captivate like after restarting the phone.
i thnk uts beter than task killer
Good app
Needs more!!!
Good task killer  that's it
Awesomeeeeee! Has every song I've searched for!
I have no idea what its deleting but I like it. It doesn't help u free space all at once, it does it slowly, but it works! In 30 mins I had 22% free space and went to 28% free space. And it'll kill apps and apparently that frees space.
I think this app is good but sometimes its jus a waist of time cuz ders no difference realy.and it keeps force closing
Best task killer on the market, however both the widgets stop working after a while. Pls fix. Ditto for the memory booster widget in the tablet version. Please put task killer widget on the tablet version as well. If these issues are fixed in the full versions, i'll definitely buy them.
I like how simple it is. Cleared up ten percent of my system memory the first time I used it.
Really helps free up memory!
Some work
Widget very useful.
Best memorykiller for my tab atm
Cool app
Good but this update not works smoothly compared to previous version
Working great on my xperia play!
A task killer wigit button would be nice
Never seems to free up more than 1kb, some of the other features are good though.
Works As It Claims My Samsung Android Slowed Down , It Has Boosted
it works my phone runs faster  now
Works fine for me
Kind a good. Bt i prefer the older version as this one works a bit lag on my samsung device.
Absolute garbage since last update. Even if the app is in the whitelist, it still kills it. Was very gd but no longer is.
Sucks....!!!
The update will not update or doesn't work.
Don't you think should have an sd option on such an app?
Very resourceful.
Cool.... It is awesome...
Im glad I got this. I have a pretty full phone. And this app helps a lot. Especially with battery.
Works great 4 me so far. My incredible kept showing a 'low on space' notification, but this gets rid of that notification & speeds up my phone.
I have tried plenty of other apps, but this outsoes them all. Great work developers! Samsung Intercept, Froyo 2.2

Wouldn't open! Force closed!
Didn't do much to keep tasks killed.
Love it. Worked great. Much faster.
Decent, worked well, but messed with my shift's multitouch routines and had to be uninstalled.
Impressive, this app is truly suprerb, HTC EVO, works great, tried other and do not compare. This is far better. Really speeds up phone. Wow!!!
The best app ever for me b4 it was slow but now wit the new update ita smooth and fast thanks. Try thissss.. rooted htc inspire 4G
Awsome app!!! Brought my 86% used space down to a 68% used space in 10 minutes. Still lowering my used space to turn into FREE SPACE!! Yessssss!
<3 Love <3 this app ... but does it have an automatic calibration/auto-boost feature, if so... Where/How?
Works okay now. I have this app bc u get internal memory n it has a task killer!
The advertisement crashes the program now, it works fine untill the ad pops up and then force close, plz plz plz fix
3.3 update is paused on my desire. Please sort it out,otherwise I have to delete it.
This is great, the best of what i've seen. Though, does it have an option to rotate with position change of phone?
I have an Android. Sanyo Zio from Sprint and this app works for me!! Its great!
This is an absolute essential app! I use this app everyday to clear up space! Just wish it could be moved to SD card!!! ~HTC Desire
I use it from time to time but I still have yet to figure out what is mainly used for.
Absolutely phenomenal makes my battery last sooooo much longer can't wait to buy the full version WAY better than juice defender!!
Mike x10 good app, but you have to buy the full version because the lite one does very little for my taste, get the android booster free is a 5 stars.
Absolutely brilliant app, does as it says, and haven't had a developer go to the lengths that these guys did when I had a glitch, all sorted thx guys

A must have for LG Optimus! Just hit "select all" then "kill selected" and it really saves my battery by killing unecessary apps. Great job!(:
Appears to be doing what its supposed to. Is it bad to follow quick boost with Android booster optimize? Are these the same thing?
Does great job giving memory space and is better and easier than android booster....
It works but some times shuts down programs I dont prompt it to.i easily restart them though.its still worth using.my android is faster & more ram

Keeps my phone running smooth. I definetly saw an improvement in my phone's performance.
I LOVE this program. But why, after I use the task killer do some programs start on their own?
Great app, best one on tje market so far. I have far less hiccups on the huawei ascend with the ram boost
Provides custom taskkilling options. Not quite strong enough to control androids agenda but works well enough to mostly satisfy. Devs happy to help.

This is along the lines of task killer and a chop-o-matic infomercial, high promise with a low return
Why does this need to know my location i dont like that but its a good program so ill trust you
While it works, it is FANTASTIC! However, I find that I must uninstall and reinstall every few days. Wish they'd fix that, but still VERY worthwhile!
I use it. Don't really knows how much it helps. But aslong as it does help
Work as well as exspected still trying to figure it out so I can save more battery memory
This app is horrible, it kept switching my phone to airplane mode no matter what I did. Un installed. Evo 4g
Very useful app...I bought the full version and the auto memory booster is absolutely critical...I no longer have to manually boost my phone
I just upgraded and.it is still telling me I need to upgrade to use all of the app or at least I paid for the upgrade and it is not upgraded yet

Freed up about 106MB on my Cliq. Went from 34MB to about 140MB free. Sped up a little too I think. I still need to do a hard reset tho.
Takes more then one try to kill app.not sure why after app is killed my 3g comes on while wi fi on? Thinking about buying full version.OB
Actually gave me more memory when installed. Motorola flipside btw which doesnt have lots of memory
This app is the shizzz love it fast like i like it does what it says it does no joke get it people good job guys
It dropped my battery17% on the install and drained it even faster when I tried to use a program see no use for this will uninstall in the morn
A quick boost would disable some necessary services like my hourly chime. Uninstalled. Better let Android manage the RAM.

If you use this app plus advanced task killer you get the maximum use and productivity from your phone. Great job :)
Works well on my touch 4g. Increases battery life abs keep phone running flawlessly.
I like this app. It frees a lot of memory but not for long... it drains battery. I added battery booster that sucked up memory. 3 stars!!

Works great on the Motorola i1! Initial problem with registration key but J---- with cust. ser. responded & I am satisfied.
Cant tell if its working or not but i can not see any improvements so far. DROID 2
My HTC desire loged down after I put it on it. I'm not pleased with it

App works great, phone runs a bit smoother. BUT it kills you battery. Droid x
I tested the veracity of what is said about this program. Does not lower internal memory according to my phone.
Works well on ZTE blade. Was sceptical at first but have to say it really seems to make a difference.

Cut my # of active apps in half according to watchdog. That's good in my book. Less apps less power used (:

This app is amazing! You must buy it! My phone is so fast thanks to this.
Great my lg optimus droid is so much faster now just needs a quick boost only thing is it kanes battery and the memory drains away again
It worked great, and did what it was suppose to. That was until I realized half my battery was being drained daily by this app. Had to unistall.
Works great. Im not sure about other probrams so im leaving room for improvement. Wish there was a deny button for some apps to auto open: ie Paypal!!
Great app quick boost deff helps allowing more free space a click of one button
I think this is better then most of the app killers out and a good memory booster much notice of the speed... EVO
Awesome app. Keeps my memory optimized as much as possible at all times. Jane in CS rocks! Fast and efficient....Evo

it was great until it deleted itself. now it just force closes everytime i try and reopen it.
Great app beings my available ram to 250mb's but wish it could keep above 200 and keep killing apps then 5 stars
Doesn't ever show open browser pages running under task kill. You have to pay via paypal for upgrade to get off of this lite version ugh...
Loved the free version. Paid for pro version and wish I didn't because the free version isn't any different. Exact same in every way possible.
It gets more memory by TAKING IT FROM YOUR MESSAGES! It took me a while to figure out why it was saying "Text message memory full". Plz dont get this!
Defo need the full version in the market. Market the full version and this will be 5*
Very handy. Phone definitely less laggy. Put full version on market for 5 stars, please!
Great app but the needlessly awkward way to buy the full version has made me give up buying it for now. Please put full version on android market.
Exceptional app that improved my battery life on the LG ally. Top 5 needed apps
Easy to use interface. Most options are only available in the full version. Very worthwhile. G1 w/CyanogenMod.
I asked 4 full version product key cuz i got a replacement phone & was denied cuz they "only offer replacement 4 1device". 1* simply 4 this fact.
Very useful for busy individuals /and/or people who don't like to empty phone logs, and text and download every application etc, awesome app,
Works great on x10. I use atk still but this clears way more memory so I use it when my memory isn't cleared enough by atk.
Got key but nowhere to enter it. Bought it twice & still have light version.
New update doesn't clean as much on free version. I would clear 70-90mgs before now only 10-15mg. I may just uninstall it now.
Hate it. The fact that it's always running actually slowed down my phone. Uninstalled.
Awesome program. Purchased full version couldn't be happier with the level of support.
Bare essentials. Forces you to purchase FULL VERSION. Minimal freeing up of RAM,don't bother!
LG gt540 worked like a treat. Like to see more detail of what's been removed.
Very good application. Always room for improvment. Will buy full version when I get Defy. Made my Cliq XT work like new.
It works great but it kind of froze my screen so I had to take battery out and uninstall cause i downloaded from internet. Htc evo 4g. Please fix
Outstanding app. Helps my Droid2 runs better. Would highly recommend as a standard app on anyones phone.
Outstanding app. Helps my Droid2 runs better. Would highly recommend as a standard app on anyones phone.
This is by far the best app I have ever found. The full version doubles as a task manager with auto kill option definitely worth the $2.99 for full.
OK app.but fc after boost then phone goes black.has to re boot. Please fix.or why bother. Jdroid
Works better than i ever imagined! Great app and great support! I bought the full version and it is even better than the lite! Highly recommend. Droid
Took my captivate from 115mb free to 210mb which was cool. But makes phone laggy sometimes. Uninstall
Worked perfectly on my backflip, didn't crash my phone like the other comments said.
Seemed good. But the memory it gives u just goes back down in like 10 mins. Uninstalled..
Works well on my evo. It saved over 100 mb of memory with one boost.
Unnecessary bordering on counterproductive. RAM takes no time to clear, and uses the same amount of power whether it is in use or not.
good job!!  really really make different... galaxy y duos

I just want to take a try due to so many great comment, and then... I love this great lightweight and super useful memory tuning app. It is definitely the most superb andriid system utility up to today. A must have for every android S2 holder. Recommend!!!
This application is cool..
Great App Helps My Memory Greatly Thank You For The Update
Really Works! Give It A Try.
After using a few task killers and start up managers this one works the best and freed up 90mb of ram! Job done.
Makes ur ram at the lowest point possible making ur fone MUCH MUCH FASTER. RECOMMENDED!  (This is my first review of any application, it only shows how much magic it does on ur phone. TRY IT NOW!)
Better for micromax my funbook
This is one of the best optimisers for any android system.
Love the options and the fact it works in backgroung. However I am getting a download error code 927 when I y to update. Can you please fix this?! 10x lot
Other task killers on the market are useless and a waste of time. This is awesome. For people who don't understand what this does, it is tweaking your phone's native memory management keep your phone snappy. It does NOT kill apps in the same sense other so called task killers do.
Nice
It works great  Just wait for sometime and analize the performance of your phone..........
Its one of the best apps in the market. Simple to use and very effective.
Very impressive worth download

Was really good but no reason to access my location. Too many permissions without justification, uninstalling..
Great works well all the time but it will freeze one time out every two months but not enough to not give it five stars I love it thank you for this app
Awesome app.. Surely a must download for every android

I have a Nexus 7 tablet and while it worked as advertised it had a MINOR glitch on exit. I contacted support and got an immediate reply. They were working on it and it was resolved!  It works  I endorse it. I'd give it 10 stars, but only 5 exist.

I paid!  I like it!
Very nice. But now am using full version. Itz really working fast
Even though it's not gorgeous, it does exactly what it says, and does it splendidly. That's enough for me.
Great tool and works efficiently. A must have!
This app took me from 23% free RAM to 56%!! Easily one of the most useful apps I've installed! For the paltry $3, don't even waste your time with lite! Too many of the really good features are turned off in the free version.
good
This is good. It never turns me down;-)
Without getting in the way and always running like other apps
Its nice ware.
Work likes charm.

Used this app for years, it iz the most efficient memory booster. It saves my life. Thanks
Waw
Droid 3 used to be fast, and has since slowed down drastically. Used advanced task killer, which didn't work very well. Memory booster light has a task killer widget you can install on your homepage and works very well to temporarily give your phone a boost of speed.

Yet to examine '
This is awesome and sucks
Works well like mah dick
works osum on my mobile..<3 it :-)
"Killed" apps still running. If it's not doing this it probably not doing anything else.
Amazing app..must have...!!!!
Woooooooow Good performance
Let's see if it works lmfao hoping it does what it says it doesn't
A+++ App!  Must have application
this app really helps me cut almost half of my RAM usage!! It's really amazing, best RAM optimizer so far.. How I wish I have enough resources to purchase the full version.. Great work IMOBLIFE INC.!!

Worked fine
EVO 4G was always at 38G.  I'd always have to clear data etc when updating market apps.  At first this app got me to around 50G, good enough to install apps.  After a restart I have 100G free.  And it's staying at 100G!  WOW!
Does what it promises. Very easy to use.
Perfect and complete. It really does his job. Best App for RAM management.
Could not live without this app. I have the worst phone in the world and this app is a life saver!
Awesome!!!!!
This app is a great app if your cell has many unesssry apps running in background. My cell is now running less than half of the full ram. I very reccomend this app
I have had came across many 'optimizers' but this one is the only one that works for me.
.
Sooo good
Gooooooooooooooooooooood
This app is amazing. Its 10x better than every task killer on the market. It's the only app that wont just get rid of user opened apps. it gets rid of running services also
Awesome $$$$
It's kinda good and useful. Thumbs up!
Cool app

Befoure using this app i couldnt played fpse (playstation emulator) for more than 15 min, the system killed fpse becouse it was running out of free ram. I bought the full version and set it to boost memory every 10 min, now i can play all day and it still wont forceclose. I just have to refill the battery :) I use it on LG Optimus

Nice app to have, clears your phone with the ever so precious memory. Although sometimes it requires a few clicks to activate quick boost (must be my newly-installed ics). Nonetheless, an indispensable app that is worth the download.
Like   e
good app
Got it, tried it, lost a couple of actions (scrolling up, selecting apps, and selecting Manage Apps) among others... Had to restart phone to uninstall... Quite a scare... Had this app for about 10 mins, if that... HTC Thunderbolt.
Used to love it but since  my phone updated to ice cream sandwich it just keeps force closing. Uninstall!
I tried a variery of booster, but this one is obviously the best. Easy and effective!

I love it!
A "Must Have" for anyone who wants a snappy & juicy phone.
В памяти он, конечно, болтается, как мне показалось. Но отъедает немного, а чистит не в пример лучше Adwanced Task Killer.  И белый список, и очитска по расписанию тоже имеются.
Nice appz.
Works great
Simple and useful. With one booster my phone is twice faster. Very impressive!
On my.x8, phone was lagging massively,  this automatically 'boosts' when started and makes the phone feel like new again. Much less slow Downs. :-)
Ok

Amazing. My phone is fast again!!
Never seems to free up more than 1kb, some of the other features are good though.
Kills apps and they are back running in 5 sec.  I want an app killer that keeps them killed until I'm really to use them again. Is there such an app
It realy helps:-) must hve app;-)
Amazing!!!

About time you brought this back on the market. Best task manager to have on a Droid phone. Would pay for a full version!
Works well on my DHD just about to do the update hope it stays good
Absolutely brilliant app, does as it says, and haven't had a developer go to the lengths that these guys did when I had a glitch, all sorted thx guys

Not updating because of SD removal. If you want widget, don't move to SD & quit being an rTard.
I texted them about the upgrade not being there & they said to upgrade. Lmao! Guess english is their 2nd language. I texted back. Text them.
It seems that if my memory is to low, I cannot launch this to speed up my phone. Other than that, great app. (Before update, have not updated yet.)

Why does it keep asking if I want to update every time I open the app when I already updated? Please fix! Droid x

Not worth a *#%* took up more ram then i had before i installed it
A must have for LG Optimus! Just hit "select all" then "kill selected" and it really saves my battery by killing unecessary apps. Great job!(:
Great app. People say their apps crash. That's because this shuts them down to free memory. Add apps to the list to prevent unintentional shutdown.
Installed and my phone slowed down to a crawl. Market app pictures wouldn't load, internet could barely load. Not recommended. Evo

Has done everything I wanted it to! Have one problem (not with this app) but how do permanently delete other apps on Samsung Transform? I've tried b4
This is an excellent program really helps after my droid is upgraded to 2.2, and thank you so much to Jane for her prompt reply on the usage
Highly Recommended! Keeps my phone running smooth & the Task-Killer just works like it's supposed to! Love the graphical interface in real-time.

I LOVE this program. But why, after I use the task killer do some programs start on their own?
Great app, best one on tje market so far. I have far less hiccups on the huawei ascend with the ram boost

Provides custom taskkilling options. Not quite strong enough to control androids agenda but works well enough to mostly satisfy. Devs happy to help.
Liked the app but one feature it didn't do was kill idle apps. apps I never opened were running like sprint nfl, navigator...

First I saw low memory... Then I ran this thing and it gave me half of my memory back without losing anything- the phone loads quicker too!

I use it. Don't really knows how much it helps. But aslong as it does help
Work as well as exspected still trying to figure it out so I can save more battery memory
This program in this version definitely causes crashes of programs which use own caching mechanisms.You'd rather not use it if you're not a risk lover
This app is horrible, it kept switching my phone to airplane mode no matter what I did. Un installed. Evo 4g

Rooted users should stick with AutoKiller Memory Optimizer, it is not this obstrusive...
Great app but I wiah the developer would release the paid verison thru android market not through paypal web
Great app which will help you optimize your android to the Max. Helps with low memory error which happens frequently on the Droid Incredible.

Great app works wonders with the Samsung galaxy s running 2.2 froyo. This with battery booster and dark hd wallpaper gives great battery life
Screwed up my phone! Made all my programs force close and slowed down my phone big time. Good idea but horrible app!
May be force closing other programs after the quick boost command. I am running a flashed 2.1.1 but I don't think it's a firmware malfunction. X10a.
Every thing that would be even remotely helpful is only on the paid version. Why even bother with a free version?
Doesn't work with most current update for the samsung fascinate. It'll mess with your display when malling calls.

This app is so stupid. It takes longer to boost ur phones battery. The best app is battery booster. It 10 min battery went up by 8%. Reccomend it :-)

REALLY helped my MyTouch 3g. It could never view YouTube videos before. Got to gain memory via Quick Boost and killing most Apps first, though.

A quick boost would disable some necessary services like my hourly chime. Uninstalled. Better let Android manage the RAM.
If you use this app plus advanced task killer you get the maximum use and productivity from your phone. Great job :)

Works great but really don't need it for Droid X. Doesn't drain battery that's good.
Helps me turn off things that turn on all the time, uses a lot of battery power, i can delete apps, erase history, and tms and its same memory used!
Needs the ability to buy through market. This round about way is pathetic. Can't give better rating because of pre purchase unknowns.
This app is amazing! You must buy it! My phone is so fast thanks to this.
One of the apps I use several times a day. My phone can't live without it.
I bought the paid version and have it set up so it keeps my memory at a good level all the time. In addition, the customer support are really great.
Well I have put this app on all my phones. I have installed it on my acer liquid e, Galaxy s GT i9000 and just put it on my Dell Streak. Love it

Love the update now I can use task killer here. All in one. Goodbye atk.
Works great. Optimizer works well, ram recovery is good, and the task killer is excellent. Can kill anything with it.
It gets more memory by TAKING IT FROM YOUR MESSAGES! It took me a while to figure out why it was saying "Text message memory full". Plz dont get this!

Excellent program on my galaxy s. Worth upgrade to full version, and support staff are extremely helpful.
Defo need the full version in the market. Market the full version and this will be 5*
Really great app this should be pre-installed as standard system app on every android device! Highly recommend
Great app. Now I can abandon Atk after this new update! Thanks dev for your continued effort
Might be a fluke , however after downloading this into my facinate my phone went crazy, it began to lag & freeze. As I stated, could be a fluke.
Great app but the needlessly awkward way to buy the full version has made me give up buying it for now. Please put full version on android market.
Exceptional app that improved my battery life on the LG ally. Top 5 needed apps
Easy to use interface. Most options are only available in the full version. Very worthwhile. G1 w/CyanogenMod.

The BEST app since I got my Samsung Epic 4G. Everyday I clear 50-70,000,000 Bytes RAM=faster phone=battery life up by 4 hrs w/ Advanced Task Killer
This increased RAM 50m on use, use it daily. Does more than just app kill
Works great on x10. I use atk still but this clears way more memory so I use it when my memory isn't cleared enough by atk.
Great. Installation of this app is one of the smartest choices I made. It does a fabulous job!

New update doesn't clean as much on free version. I would clear 70-90mgs before now only 10-15mg. I may just uninstall it now.
I use this app all the time. Considering purchasing to have the auto boost run. My Galaxy S runs super quick now. Thanks dev!

Hate it. The fact that it's always running actually slowed down my phone. Uninstalled.

Bare essentials. Forces you to purchase FULL VERSION. Minimal freeing up of RAM,don't bother!
Works great for my new desire! Recovers 5M with a quick boost. My phone works like a charm with this amazing app. Upgraded to full version a min ago.

I had doubts about this app, but after using it for a week I am definitely a believer! This is worth upgrading to the paid version!
Best of best! My droid works 100 times faster than ever! I will recommend it to all my friends. Amazing job!
Got 1000apps on my galaxy s,and it was laggy recently(even after lagfix).Thanks to this app,my phone is blazing fast again!Would pay more for that!

Actually it makes my battery life lasts longer michael..This app works far better than atk. Very functional and smart.
Upgraded from free version to full version. Worth for money! Excellent customer service! Highly recommended! 6-stars indeed!
I luv this app even thoe its a lite version i give it 5 stars great wit my g1,and customer service was on time "give it a boost" ur phone will luv it.
Great program that cancles out task and optimizes my phone. Their customer support also seems very dedicated.
This is by far the best app I have ever found. The full version doubles as a task manager with auto kill option definitely worth the $2.99 for full.
I think this app does what it says. My droid x works faster and much smoothly than ever. Great tool!
The memory booster is not good to have on the Samsung Vibrant because when it restores memory, it crashes or may shutdown an application.
Purchased the pro and it works perect on samsung vibrant. Now my android runs like new...great job dev..5 Stars all the way....

Most tasks it kills come right back. Every 10 min. cpu usage is the same.
Would get five stars if FULL version, or key, was available on "Android Market"...But, it's NOT! Dev uses own Papal account, on his own website :-/
OK app.but fc after boost then phone goes black.has to re boot. Please fix.or why bother. Jdroid
Works better than i ever imagined! Great app and great support! I bought the full version and it is even better than the lite! Highly recommend. Droid
Great app for lower end android phones. Pay app worth the $3 Blaze running 1.6
Felt like it helped on my droid but the droid x is another story... May even slow it down =/
Worked perfectly on my backflip, didn't crash my phone like the other comments said.
not bad but can get free apps that that do more for task management. Uninstall
I like it but when i try to upgrade, my information keeps deleting before I can process payment :(
Paid version is well worth....especially good for my rooted Droid with froyo. Now I don't need a new phone due to the 256mb on Droid.
This app combined with ATK is great. Even though my HTC evo 4g has never had any slow downs even with 15-20+ app running in the background.
Seemed good. But the memory it gives u just goes back down in like 10 mins. Uninstalled..
Works well on my evo. It saved over 100 mb of memory with one boost.
Awesome contrary to what other comments say.this.thing rocks it helps.by about.49 m
Awesome. Prefer garbage collection to task killer any day! Best to use a few min/hours after a reboot, or before gaming.
Unnecessary bordering on counterproductive. RAM takes no time to clear, and uses the same amount of power whether it is in use or not.

Awesome app. Works great on my Nexus One. Full version well worth the money, frees up even more memory and keeps my device humming.

When tapping the whitelist, it fc's and restarts the os, motorola droid, other than that it does work, fix the fc and reboot ill buy it
Very misleading app. They want you to buy it outside market to do anything useful.
Worst app I ever got. I tried to purchase it and of course they took my money with no product to show. And when I tried to get my money back. No luck.
Before the latest update it was a good apps with only limitation is auto activate of the apps. Now with whitelist added in, only way to select is pay
Functionality is very limited unless you buy full version. Not much difference on memory boost. Free memory is better, no limitations.

Robert, I want to thank you for your fast support. I greatly appreciate it. 5 stars! :-)
Probably does work for most people, but just slowed the system down on my Droid.
