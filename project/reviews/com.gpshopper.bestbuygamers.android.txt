Heard about this app from an employee at Best Buy.  Was stoked to find out what my games are worth, and it doesn't work at all!  Every game I scan say's, "No Results Found."  I hope it gets fixed soon!!!
Every time I scan a game, it says the item isn't found. Immediate uninstall.
I am very dissapointed with this app. I can't believe that bby fails so hard on this
It doesn't save to library even though the app says is doing it.
It doesn't give me what I want. At the bottom of the screen it says call of duty modern warfare 3. I don't want that game. Don't download it.
Save your games to the library . Later when you go back to look at them they magically disappear. App should be called Lucky Charms.
Games in library does not show and apps says I have them saved in my library don't waste your time
I added all my games and after about 2 weeks, now it says no games in library...but look at recently viewed and it has the minus sign to remove the game from my library...removed and re-added and still no games in library..
it always force close
It won't even open. It force closes everytime. Droid X.
It won't even open. It force closes everytime. Droid X.
Force Close every time
Won't find any of my games. This really sucks!!
I too work at best buy and this is embarrassing for me and my customers.
It can't find any game I scan, even games I bought within the last month.
Wont even open phuk you!!!
It was bull crap took 15 to scan and almost never finds my games.
I scanned every game i own and it found nothing. Even games just released a week ago. Completely failed at what it was supposed to do.
The search feature is absolutely dreadful. What good is this app if you can't look up a game?
Since the update it can't find a single game
Doesn't find anything by text or by bar code. Tried scanning KoA Reckoning and it couldn't find anything. Terrible app as it stands.

It search doesn't work at all.
Couldn't find trade in values for even big name games like Battlefield 3, Madden, or Forza by searching by name or by barcode.
One star because if it worked it would be a great app I typed in and scanned all my games and no results were found. HTC evo
Doesn't work for Asus Transformer Prime.
Almost unuseable, be a great app if they would fix it
Everytime I try and search for a game it says it isn't found. Thank god its free because it isn't worth a penny
Completely unusable. Galaxy s Captivate.  Deleted and and redownloaded the app 3 times and it still refuses to function. All I get is a loading screen
Barcode fails to find games even new ones, game title search brings up one copy for one console but not others it is available in, a game added to the library has right cover art but wrong title (sonic rush for DS is listed as Infamous 2 for PS3!), sometimes games added to library do not show up at all... do yeah, major issues in a program that used to be alright. Did I mention that I WORK at Best Buy in the gaming department?  Quite embarrassing for me.
It force closes too often, and when you select a game it opens a different games' window and is gone when you click back. Worst app ever.
Bestbuy fix this app force close
Scanned probably 20 different games over 3 systems....it cant find any of them.  Kinda  Pointless app until it's fixed.
Scanned numerous titles and never seems to find the game unless I type it in.
None of the PS3 games I scan can be found in their database.  I try manual entry and they are still not found.  Titles like Orange Box or Portal 2 can't be found?  Time to step up the game Best Buy.
Scanned numerous games, didn't find a single one not even when manually searched. Tried Wii, PS2, PS3, Xbox, Xbox360, nothing found
I've scanned and even manually searched. Ironically when the apparently opens it said they just updated and wanted feedback. What a junky app.
Wont even open. Good job best buy
" The application game trade in has stopped unexpectedly. Please try again and again." Does not work!
This just force closes every time i try to use it! Droid charge
Horrible please do yourselves favors and go to game stop you don't need all these flashy corporate bs to know where the good stuff is
you to use GPS? Force Closes afterwards! Realy?
Yet again best buy takes a good idea and ruins it. Search by text is insanely sensitive and fails to find half my games even with barcodes.
Keeps crashing on my sensation 4g.
Doesn't show half of my games and the prices are outrageous.... MW3 for 18.... It hasn't even been out for 2 months....
Way low prices
It keeps forceing close
Force close immediately. 0 stars
Updated...now it crashes...fail
I can't believe I can get better values from a company that doesn't even have an app like this.. Yet. Best Buy? "POWER UP!"

Wouldn't work on Samsung infuse. Kept force closing.
Sucks
Just says loading location and doesn't go any further. HTC Thunderbolt
It just keeps saying loading location and does nothing for hours!!!
Everytime app opens i have to type in my city. Wish there was a default i could use instead.
I got this to check return/trade-in values on games. The scan function is useless; I had to manually enter titles. Lackluster/cheap looking interface.
Used to love this app, hasn't updated news feed in months so is completely outdated and useless

Keeps freezing. Won't update location. Sometimes takes forever. Will give two different prices on a game.
Looking for location for over an hour. Manually select a location and the deals never load... doesn't work, don't waste your time.
This app is good for trade in values but besides that its useless. The top games and preorders are gamenobodies heard of. No mention of mw3 or bf3
How come the main Best Buy app can be moved to an SD card and this can't? Should've hired the same creator for both.
Why does your app need access to my bookmarks or browser history? Explain why these permissions are needed
Great app for scanning values if it works. Crashes on scanner for samsung intercept. Great on 4th gen ipod touch with wifi connection.
Pointless, I can get all the info on this app, and some, from bestbuys website

When trying to find the trade-in value of call of duty: black ops, it couldn't find the game. Kind of worthless if no games have trade-in values.
Terrible app. Doesn't even bring up stores close to me. Don't waste time with this one
Tried to lookup game trade in values...won't find anything by keyword, even with something so popular as mario. (Droid2)
Needs access to contacts? Needs access to browser history? Really? No thanks. Deleted.

The trade in part doesn't list half the game I have. I'll still go to Gamestop since they take the games I have.
App is OK, and just OK. Has access to Bookmarks, History, and *Contact Info*, though?! No way. Uninstalled!
Can't find anything!! Every search I did had no results even for new releases HTC evo
Worthless app. I scanned every game I have even cod MW2 and the scanner just kept saying item not found and some of the games were from BB. Uninstall

This app is great, very helpful on the go. @Mark g4 sucks, their opinions depend on what companys pay them to say thier games are good
This app sucks, it's slow and uninformative, I couldn't find anything useful, the G4 app is far superior.

Best buy is my mecca, but this app has limited use if youre wanting to just browse games.
It used to be a good app and very informative but now I'll type in a name of a game and it says, "no results found" and before you try to defend it I typed in 10 game names, full names, with nothing, then I went on the best buy site and it worked fine. FIX IT!
But now it is garbage. My Games have disappeared from the library. I liked knowing what my current collection of 50+ PS3 games were worth, but now this app is only good for individual look ups! It took a while to put all my games in just to have them disappear!
About a third of searches bring back a result. Fix it you hookers
I tried to scan a few games.  The app didn't find the games.  I even tried to type in a game title to search by.  It still didn't work.
Better off just going to best buys web site.
No minnesota stores listed.  G2
Completely leaves out PC games.
Search by keyword and upc is a joke if the game is newer
Doesn't seem to support PC games, when searching always comes up blank. Lots of potential though.
Nice to have this available from my phone whenever I need it! Now best buy allow us to move to the SD card please!
Its ok, needs update. Droid X.
Cool app. I just wish that it would list pre order bonuses like gamestop does

Pretty useless app, just taking up space. And Amazon gives much better trade value than best buy FYI, only fools go to gamestop expecting a deal.
Get rid of the need to find my location. Takes like 10 mins before I can use this app!

Always force closes.However,when it does work it is awesome!
Used to work flawlessly. I work at Best Buy and was able to show customers the barcode scanner and worked amazing. Now it cannot find a single thing. Please fix. It is embarrassing when I go to show a customer how much he will get in trade and it doesn't bring anything up.
GPS aided location turned on = force close. Turn it off and it works. Not sure why this app requires me to enable location services. If you need my location, ill type my zip.
Only console systems seem to be puling up. Very sad
Not bad but could be alot better. SGS Vibrant 2.2
Where are the pc preorders and where are the video previews?? Lost of possibilities with this app. Also an option to sort preorders by date.
Good idea needs improvement
Cool app. I just wish that it would list pre order bonuses like gamestop does
Like that you can scan your games and find their value for trade-in. App crashes on g2x when viewing library.

Finds few older games by searching keyword... the barcode scanner seems to work every time though. Force closes a lot. DroidX
it's ok...good concept. needs some tweaking tho. still a bit glitchy. sd card installs should be mandatory for all apps period!! listen up google!!
Awesome concept and very cool app!! Yet it keeps force closing on my Tbolt, please fix for 5 stars*****
Ambivalent about app. I don't trade my games so there isn't any point for me.
Would be wonderful if I didn't have to reset my location every time I open the app. Works well otherwise.
Graphics need to be updated. Please allow to move to SD. Samsung Galaxy S Epic 4G.
Please fix trade in value keyword search unable to locate any games also add only game related items to games club
I just like it because I can scsn the trade values quickly. Other than that. Meh
I wish it would tell you if it is a multi player game. All it does is give you the description of the game.
Needs access to contacts? Needs access to browser history? Really? No thanks. Deleted.
It's a good app but still buggy, seeing product photos constantly changing. Htc EVO.

I can see how much games are worth before going to the store. Screw gamestop!!!
Works pretty well. The reward zone linking is an issue, you have to log out and back in adding time and extra steps any time you want to look into a party that seems like it's a party of this app. The RZ sign in page is cut off and shows basically 1 line.   The library save feature with values and numbers of games is nice.
Gives basic trade in price- not including any mention of promotions or the @gamer club card.  Good app though.
Great app works great
It does basic stuff but it could be made smoother and more efficient
Everytime app opens i have to type in my city. Wish there was a default i could use instead.

Does what it says
i think it works pretty well, just sucks how little my games are worth now
It work I have 62 ps3 games you just have to work it a bit LoL
People are dumb for rating it low
Works perfect,  I think alot of the people rating low just don't know what there doing.
Great app
We do an lot of gaming and have a lot of old games! Best Buy was giving us 2-10 times more than GameStop or any other video game store. Plus we pre ordered a game and got even more on those trade in! Best Buy is awesome. The app could use some work, but the trade in experience rocked. We will keep coming back!
Sweet app, just like the website. Plus you can access the deals and coupons right on the screen. You can decipher the outcome of your trade from home.
I love looking up trade in values for games!
It's a nice app however if you simply download the "Best Buy" app you get all these features plus a better app, more frequent updates & a nicer look.
Everytime app opens i have to type in my city. Wish there was a default i could use instead.
Can't be traded in anywhere because that would be illegal and u could forge a product key and a million other reasons. Pc gamers need to do less QQ

All you need is your gps on and it works great super fast for scanner. Best buy has the best deals on games. amazon takes forever to get any money
Love the scan feature to look up trade in values. Way better pay outs than game stop. Verizon incredible.
