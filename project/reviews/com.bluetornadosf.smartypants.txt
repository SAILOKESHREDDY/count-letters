It slows my phone down tremendously and freezes a lot
When asked what color the sky was she responded by explaining what Manchester Football Club was.  Constantly prompts you to do things you don't want to do.   Programmed with spelling errors. Just awful.
I downloaded Skyvi for Car Mode, which claims to be hands-free. It's NOT! Only the first spoken text after starting Car Mode is hands-free. After that it requires that I push the microphone icon for further use! That's not hands-free!  On top of that, it keeps the screen on, which really drains the battery! And it can't do searches without GPS on ... another major battery drainer. Especially annoying is all the screen clutter with ads and popups, like whenever text messages arrive even after I've shutdown Skyvi! Also annoying are the popups trying to entice me to spread its word on my Facebook and Twitter accounts.
very poor
Yikes!  I'll update review if things get better.
But incredibly annoying pop ups. Uninstall.
Very limited compared to Alice and other similar android apps. Hate the new voice. Many errors It fails to hear my voice often and will sometimes continue waiting after I finish a phrase. I also believe many of the high reviews are from what people read in the description. Please work harder on the capabilities; It needs less wit, more knowledge. Uninstalled.
I downloaded this app. It worked great for 2 days. Then I lost the volume. I tried all I knew to fix this issue. I believe there is some conflict with the bluetooth settings. I have even turned off all the bluetooth settings to no avail. So on August 19 I wrote to the developer for assistance. As of now no respnse. It is ashame I would have donated to the cause. But not now. I do expect developers to assist!!!!!!
Scared the crap out of me it said ( takes much more to termanate me )
I paid to have the ad's removed. But after I had to reinstall after phone problems the ads were back and they wanted more $$ to remove again. Wont respond to emails.
Didn't work well at all.
I dont.like that it records every conversation you have
This app never knows what I'm saying. Ever! I speak loudly and clearly, and it os still WAY off! I paid for this app and wish I could get my money back!
Ask it any question and it responds either by data mining or by trying to call your mom. You are better off just learning how to use your device and downloading apps that do things. If i ask, "is there a pharmacy near me," it responds, "i believe there is. How long is your drive to work?"  What? Why? I could have just done a google search. There. In a nutshell, it is inferior to a google search. If you are incapable of searching for something on google, please exit the internet immediately.
Flawless, just flawless.!
The idea was good, just not there yet. And program her to stop asking u to remove ads! Like every second...
This is a terrible at it never responds is slow and just sucks. Do not get this app
This thing has no clue, I say send text and give name and it pulls up something of the wall like trout in brook and then says it can't find, well no crap....I said Ashlie Brooke....uninstall
Dont download this it is horible
Didn't understand a word I said. It may have an issue  with a British English accent.
Don't listen to these crazy people. It's a Crap rip off that just feeds you ads unless you pay for it to stop.
Its really cool
Siri is better
Had lots of problems with msg alerts
Having issues with skyvi send emails to developer and they don't respond uninstalling
This thing dumb
Unimpressed.  I'd ask a question and the answer was never related to the question.  Too bad.  Had high hopes.  HTC 4G LTE.
It won't even access my calendar or remind me to do things.  a basic search engine at best. The Assistant app is much better.
Wow thought people were dumb
This app does a very poor job of recognizing my voice.
it started randomly talking when I wanted the phone on silent(sleeping).  Constantly get a "hold on, network is a little slow" message even though I have full bars on 4g or even wifi!  uninstalled
Totally think this app was was tapping my phone Would make random noises and a text bar popped up asking me if i was talking to it!!!
It doesnt do anything I tell it to
This app sucks uninstalling right away
Text recognition lags twenty years. Unusable. Uninstalled.
This app is terrible! It doesn't understand a word I say! When I tried to text "hi" to Jane Barrager, it tried to text "DIE!" To "my beer girls" even though "my beer girls" is not a contact on this phone
Can't even get list of movies playing at the theater.  I only gave it a star because I was required to in order to rate it.  It deserves no star for fake advertising.
This stuff sucks
This has got to b a joke iphone got to luv it
Needs allot of work. I will re download after it works
Galaxy S - disables voice to text.  Uninstalled
Rubbish!
did not like at all. it couldn't learn my voice and was too slow. uninstalled already
Sttupid X
It's a great app but it records everything
Does not work right. Does not give you enough time to speak, you say 1 thing and it gives you something different. I ask it to find a store and it gives me my address book stupidity at it's finest ... 0 stars...
Why would I want to waste my time learning a ton of commands when there's other apps like siri that u don't need to? I went 0-7 on my questions asked which earned an immediate uninstall!!!
Sucks pretty bad
Just crashes? Sensation xe
never updated well
I cant download it!!!
This sucks
I asked for when the next bus on the metro schedule would come and she said it's not important to her. Anything you say she'll reply saying it's not important, too busy, or calls you immature.
Program doesn't do many things and usually gets them wrong
And tells awsome jokes
dont waste your time.
It told me it's a virus trying to buy my phones data...
I wish i could give this app a negative 5 stars. Doesn't work at all. Stupid app.
Hasent done one thing correct
Mis translates what I say and sends wildly inappropriate/wrong messages. Source of hilarity to my recipients, not me.
Horrible
Still teaching her how to learn my friends names but seems to be okay
Sux sux sux
Doesn't understand me very often. Maybe I should try speaking another language..
This app is waste of a download
Does not talk back on the lg enlighten
Doesn't recognize contacts or anything I say, for that matter. The results offered from a successful entry are poor, and it always messes up texts! The ads are annoying too. Speaktoit Assistant is much better!   Uninstalled!!
This app was ok. A far cry from siri but ok. Now i get the same msg over and over for days even when marked as read. The time is way off as well. Uninstall till fixed
Was on the Eastern shore looking for lighthouses.  I asked for the nearest one to my location.  I got a list of restaurants.  Not even close!  The responses I get are always like that.  Wrong!  Too bad.
I said it sucks.
Ask it a question and you get a cute joke answer, but nothing useful. Trash
It wont work at all! Apperently my mic isnt working even though I'm indoors!
This is horrible
Sucks on my phone.
Still can't understand voice commands. I tried it again and ended up uninstalling after only an hour or so
Bad a.s.s
Dnt do it, its frustrating.
This sucks and didn't do a  thing it needed to. Awful .
Blows
Sucks
Great
HATE THE NEW STUFF USED TO BE AWESOME DOESNT ANSWER MY QUESTIONS JUST GIVES ME TIPS 0 STARS IF I COULD
Talks when i'm on the phone. Reads texts when it feels like it.  Doesn't understand me. Don't bother
Junk doesn't work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No comment
It has loads of adverts, the layout is crap, it doesn't answer your Q's. There is loads more to complain about but I cba to type them. I would recommend IRIS. DO NOT INSTALL.
Blows pretty hard.
Didn't do anything with my calendar which its what i downloaded it for.justkept offering to text someone -_____-
Stupid faulty app has potential
I asked tell me a joke but then she told me she can call people thid is a horrible app. Will Never answer questions you ask :',(
At first it worked but won't now push the button and it automatically canceled Motorola triumph but works great on my husband galaxy prevail and my phone is way newer than his
Ehhh
Sucks
It won't work for my smartphone of did at first so I know its the program
It doesn't even recognize it's own name. I can't think of how this app could possibly be useful. Nonsensical rubbish responses no matter how clearly I speak. Deleting it now.
I hate this app.  It is more work than it is worth.
Doesn't really do anything except ask me to rate it 5 stars and remove ads. And when I speak clearly it never works. Don't waste your time.
Can't get it to download,  I have tried 4 times now!!
No where near as good a apples, pretty much useless..
Makes me lol
I thought i was a app that would help with tasks on my phone. All it does is give  sassy answers to simple questions. My mistake. Uninstal
doesn't do anything. Just gives me stupid banter.
Doesn't work
Sucks balls not like siri at all
-  this app is fun for my 11 year old daughter.  Seems to work pretty good. I like that it's polite!!  Good app!	Good app!  I wish to change the voice!!
Sucks
I had this app rated 5 stars until the new version came out without an option to disable the auto listen function.. my phone starts talking when I'm in my car listening to music or watching tv at home
my android is only used for internet, so it doesnt text. the first step of the tutorial is to voice text someone. see my problem?
This app is frustrating!  It does not have the ability to learn to spell names which are slightly different than those in it's data base. A child's game has deeper algorithms. Worse, it responds with answers way, way off topic. Could be fun, but it is not. Disappointing after watching Apple Siri ads.
Since last update the in car icon left of screen has disappeared. Did a reload and the icon still does not appear says in advanced options how to use but theres nothing there to use so what the....
This app sucks
I bought coins and removed the annoying bloody ads i upgraded my phone and switched service but the ads are there again... Until i get this resolved i am giving 1 star. It even says i have 5 coins left so dont tell me that its not recognized as not paid when it shows my excess coins!
Every five seconds a message pops up asking if I need it. NO! I DON'T!  I'm playing a game. SHUT UP!
Drains battery... I want a refund..bought coins twice and have uninstalled the app!
Unistalled
It does not understand english when asked to do a basic tex. Don't waste your time! I'm sorry I did.
I have used better and there are not a lot of settings. Speakitto is better, don't waste your time.
I'd bang ha... :-P...
She can come in handy if you're driving and want her to access directions or play music or send a text, but other than that, she's a useless spam bot. Forget asking general knowledge questions, she'll just ask you to give her a good review or buy the paid version when she doesn't have an answer. Can get very annoying.
Works fine on HTC sensation de, fast an pretty accurate. It's developing well too.
Harm your feelings verbally using vulgars words such as jerk, idiot and many more! The voice regonisation is not so good too. So,think before downloading it!
I repeatedly asked for directions to Redmond, WA and it repeatedly wanted a conversation about the oscars!!!!  A bit silly and dangerous when trying to navigate in a car.
She sounds like she has a cold. She can hardly understand. :(
Good app
This app is dumb. Can even send a text right.
Horrible
Nothing is more discouraging than getting the dreaded Your device isn't compatible with this version.  I am running ICS and wonder what the development list looks like for this (assuming it is somewhere in the pile).   Hard to rate something you can't use.
I asked her to wake me up in 45 minutes and she said no
This app sucks. Doesnt understand anything
Using this app at first, I was pleased with the results I was getting and the functionality. Until I asked it to open my calendar (which is something apparently Skyvi can't cat do) and then it started cracking jokes and being a smart-a$$. The thing that really caught my attention was the app started asking me questions  regarding what movies I like, did I like them in 3D, did I work out and where. This application was basically asking me questions to generate ads. I also noticed the ads started changing depending on what I was talking about. The functionality is great, but the lack of complete functionality and the privacy concerns were enough for me to uninstall. That, and it was just a smart-@ss.
The tutorial should be disabled!
Doesn't work very well
When i want to txt someone it seldom works  When i wanted to know how far i was from home it said a million miles
Will not work. Tried uploading 2 different times and both times it listens and does nothing. Very disappointed.
It messes up too often
It works but it keeps telling me to do things
Assistant is better
LOCKS UP MY SG3 ALOT
Most finds the wroung  places
Could be alot better nonthing like iphone
This application is far too persistent. Also, it gets too many things I say wrong.
Not only that, but it doesn't understand half of what I say, & I speak & pronounce my words clearly. Please fix the bugs!! I don't need Skyvi talking to me when I'm on a business call or in a meeting.
It's good to send texts but won't recognize my google music.  It also can't do things like set alarms.  I would like it to not spell out things when I ask it questions.  For example I asked what the capitol of Indiana was and it said Indianapolis slash followed by pronunciations and spelling.  Some features are okay but I would like it to do more.
It says my phone doesn't have voice recognition or something when I press the button. I really wanna use this app so if it could be made to work with this phone it would be awesome.
Its ok don't understand what im sayin most times
id say a 40% accuracy. google voice works better
This app has potential but when comparing to Siri for iPhone, it lacks A LOT. it barely understand me and I speak clear English. Too many sarcastic remarks like if you ask about your schedule for the day, she says "am I a physic?" But SIRI checks your agenda for the day....
Doesn't work it doesn't talk it
Turns on Gps the entire time its on....doesnt like my bionic
This app kept updating my location and it would drain my battery like crazy. My phone usually lasted me through the night and after installing this, it'd die at 67%. I downloaded this app with my old phone and it had more options on the settings and you could control the location, but now that option isn't available. So yeah, that kind of sucks. But seriously had to install because charging may phone once a day was bad enough. Keeping this app would've meant multiple times a day and that's just too much.
so don't ask me to buy coins to use this
Couldn't find apartment on my phone to work with......
Complicated
I let u know in a few weeks...
Why does it say "hm getting late"  when your scheduling an appointment a week out?
Still trying to figure it out
The location for restaurants  leaves a lot to be desired because it missed several that are nearby and said the nearest Thai restaurant is over 20 miles away when there are several well within that distance and at least 4 within 8 miles.
Not bad needs work though
This is the third app I have used and I don't like it!
Since upate, has British accent now, and does not recognize what i say.
Its ok i would give it five of it could go on line and do thing like that but for free it ok
I enjoyed this app last week, it was an excellent replacement from the siri in my iphone. It may not be that accurate but it's a decent app. Now, when I keep on installing this app on my jellybean. It keeps saying insufficient storage available, but when I download a different app it works. I don't know how to fix this, I tried wiping cache from cwm, clearing dalvik-cache and removing unused space. Still it doesn't work. I'm gonna give this 5 stars when it finally works for me.
App works pretty well but it always wants to run. I would keep it but it kills the battery on my already battery killing EVO... Uninstall..
I am  uninstalling this app
Waste of time
God awful Microsoft Mary voice is a total turn off. I would give this a better review if it allowed for different TTS voices, like Google Voice.
Make it send whatsapp messages. Then it will be good
Will give 5 when it can open apps on my phone..I mean really, WTF?
Good app
So far not user friendly enough for me
Very unstable on ICS but it seems to have a good potential. Waiting for update...and Italian language misses!
Yep
Ok app
Just put thus on my phone. Maybe i need to get use to the app
Awesome app so helpful
Kinda sucks
This looked a great app and did give some great answers to spoken questions!  But I couldn't override the annoying response tone even by switching the phone to 'silent' mode.   Then to cap it all it did the same annoying alert when I was asleep to let me know that it had lost wifi contact . . . after that I had to uninstall. Great idea but it looks like you've concentrated on the complex stuff first without too much attention to user interface/experience.
So far is sub par
Thats why I'm only giving it 2 stars nothing really great and I don't like the whole by coins for ad free and extras iris is better and faster
I think this is so cool but it's so basic and robotic it's kinda annoying. It needs more time to smooth out
Gay
This program is ok
Speaktoit is much better.  This doesn't understand what I am saying as well
Doesnt understand me
Nothing like work don't bother
Luv it
This is complicated
Good
Rubbish
Started off really strong, but then tapered off extremely fast not understanding most words that I say. Not to mention I paid to have the ads removed, even after a restart the ads are still there. Not nearly as useful. Pretty much just a novelty piece.
Can't even do simple task like open calendar. Tweets, texts and that's about it....
If you have a Southern accent forget it. It will not understand you and you get all kinds of results. But hey so does siri also.
Has craptastic recognition and skyvi is sort of retarded at least the free version is.
She didnt even know what 5 times 7 is lol and said she isnt good at math
It sucks! Nd is way to slow....doesnt understand words that arent in a dictionary eg....my name!
As expected, the algorithms are pathetic. It's too dumb to even take money to remove ads. Zero stars if it didn't make me laugh.
The only reason I gave it two stars its because it supports bluetooth option. however it did not recognize anything that I requested from it, the settings are very limited, and the voice is not only annoying but it its also very unclear. The AVIC app is far superior.
E
Asked for pizza near me it told me places 257 miles away. Asked for pizza in my city name and it doesn't recognize it, gives me pizza around the state capital. Useless for me.
Nice start, but nowhere near as sophisticated as siri or assistant.
It responds and recognizes commands faster than vLingo, but crashes frequently and the UI is awful. The tts engine is also less advanced than vlingo.
How can an app that's so chatty not even speak? I'm the 1 asking the questions here. And it doesn't understand basic things like setting appointments, tasks and reminders. Uninstall. DROIDX
I appreciate the effort, but it's just not there yet. Barely usable. Worth a few minutes of amusement I suppose. Uninstalling.
It's fun but there's a lot of work to be done. Inaccurate and not so rich...can't stand against the siri application.
This app is great
It constantly asks to remove ads and rate... Kinda annoying but still an alright app
Pretty great little app more or less Droid siri with a little personality but since I now have samsungs s-voice working on my nexus and its more of what functionality I wanted I think I will uninstall skyvi since she is more useful as a chatbot that a personal assistant.
It's good in terms of quickness but it barely picks up what you say and its annoying
Works well. Bought the app and I have emailed the developer 3 times for support. Never got any reply.
Still needs some work
But doesnt sound like siri
If you ask stupid questions you will get a laugh
It's saying things I didn't ask for
Querky... Plus it keeps force closing.  But fun.
It has some bugs... like it doesnt always do what you want it to. But i do like it. It is cool: ) It does mess up what i say and does not respond correctly.
Let's hope she get better when I get use to it
Works well
Other Siri wannbe's can do things like set your alarm clock or get into other apps. It's fun but not as advanced as some.
Fun app takes a bit to get use to... slightly interrupts when making a command. Still need more time to mess around but I think its worth trying.
I enjoy using skyvi a lot. My only complaints are that I can't set alarms and I can't ask it for questions about current events (i.e. Who won last night's sporting event)
This soft ware is ok
I like this app but it doesn't always  understand me and always wants me to say Starbucks ????
It understod me but kept askin unrelated questions after I gave it commands I don't like it!
I love that it has an attitude but it mistakes a lot of my words. And it frustrating me with all the " can you help me" all the time asking to be rated. So there your rated.
Its pretty cool after u figure out how to use it
I just got this app so I am not sure how accurate it is but so far it has been fun.
Could be better
Robot voice sucks. Need other options.
Its working superb
Not bad at all....
Hahaha. I love this app.
I have a droid evolution and it keeps saying bad connection, idk if I have to download another app too? This one looks awesome...just wish it would work on my phone!!!
Eh. I don't hate her though
Works well but doesn't really do much.
This app is ok. She need to stop jumping into her own thing tho.
Its ok but it doesn't pick up words so good
Found it confusing when speaking it was asking randomly if I wanted to send a text also it needs more knowledge because when asked a simple question it can't usaully answer needs a lot of work to match to I phone siri
Its fun at first but when you really need to use it you will know it needs more features like reminders and I would like it if the voice was more human like.
This app is cool n annoying at the same time...always stuck in the RAM and drains my xperia ray battery!!!
Hopefully she can do better and learn bit not bad
Works ok just sometimes sounds depressing
Just downloaded,trying to get it to text but doesnt understand me. May not have it long.
There' s words that the assistant cannot understand noy even trying to speak slow and accurate ..  ASSISTANT APP.understood what i wanted to text very accurate needs improvement guys , the app. is not bad but needs more effort guys !!!
its okayy could be. better.
I like the car mode so it can read my text messages to me while on the road and I don't have to worry about looking at the phone. It is not so smart on the dialing though, I had to tell it to "learn" the same person over and over. It repeated the name correctly, but when I asked to "call" that person, Skyvi would return with "teach me"... I had better luck with Speaktoit
Does not work well with Indian accent. Kept repeating my wife's name and out kept saying call Jim.
I had 2 alter my rating down a couple pegs since u guys censored Skyvi,  I mean you could have a parental lock or something.    Freedom of Speech!    ???
Says too much random nonsense
Sometimes she cant hear.
Needs more improvement. But not bad.
She doesn't seem to understand me very well. I keep asking her what I should call her and she keeps calling sue. This is very annoying because I don't want to call Sue. And she often writes down the question exactly but I don't get the right answer. She also doesn't seem to have the humor personality that siri does. I'm not sure how useful she'll be since I can do the same thing with my google button. And she doesn't seem to come with a calendar. But it's amusing to play with. And it is free . . .
Okkkkkk
Is good, not what i expected but good
Ok but can b annoying sometimes and need to no how to skip music that u dont want to hear but ok overall
Ok
Meh
Skyvi kinda takes to long to reply to my questions!
Needs alot and alot of updates
Fun and easy...still figuring it out, but looking forward to making mundane tasks more enjoyable.
Skyvi is awesome
She should be able to hear you a little clearer so she can learn the na
Ap is okay still has bugs hope it gets better
Cool ap but the ads suck.
Fun
I enjoy the witty comments but some bugs can stand fixing like better flow in the words and little stuff. It really makes a difference. And screw the coins bull.
Love it!!!!
Could use a lot more commands
Great app!!!
Great program
It's not as good as siri but its works
A good start.
App ok but Automated voice sucks.
I am still not sure but so far it's ok.
Not exactly Siri but its ok. Could be more interactive like reading out incoming messages, emails, etc..
Works Great
Is ok but it keeps asks me to call people or write review
Its ok
First of all let me clarify, I can't stand apple products. I've used my wife' siri. This is not near as good as siri. The artificial intelligence is lacking. The voice recognition does not work near as well. Interaction with the phones applications is poor. Listening to the computer generated voice is not pleasant.  Siri does not work that great to begin with.  I wish google / android would come out with something better.
It works but still need to be improved.
I called her stupid and she said i will remember that when the robots take over the world. Pretty scary.
Nice app but have the same proble m speaking and start the task.. Fix and ill give 5 stars
Voice is a little robotic and annoying but does ok.. Won't get my name though.
Has some glitches but it's alright needs improvement
Its prettycool
Decent app
It goves random crap every now and than but fun to sctew wit
Good
Can't do everything I would like but it's pretty cool so far wish I could do my calendar
Still trying to figure it out but so far its pretty cool.
Ok
All the high ratings and reviews made the app not live up to it's hype I'm not really impressed
Not quite as good as siri but good enough
So far so good No real complaints yet
Can't update calendar, move/add/cancel appts, or open other apps. Recognizes commands pretty well, but isn't any better than Google voice (which doesn't charge to remove ads). Pretty much the same as all the other Siri wannabes out there, uninstall.
Just installed and mean JUST installed this app! So far it seems amazing!!! I'm sure as time passes and I use it more frequently, it'll be a 5 star app!
The app looks neet sadly though on my galaxy pro cell phone it gives the message that my phone doesn't understand speach. Befor it would tell me I don't have a mic. Ill keep an eye on this app I realy do want it and would like to get to play with it.
kinda confusin and freakin woman is demandin lol
Cool so far
Awesome
Voice to text better than standard soft. But restaurant find feature needs work. Also desc.  says it tells jokes. It tells only one joke. Only keeping for text feature. Still better than other siri wannabees lg optimus metro pcs
:)
Enough said
Its cool.
Need imdian accent
Does most of what I want....   Although it relies too much on It's dictionary." when playing music.  When I ask it to play KorRN, it thinks "corn", then plays CCR.
She is much better than before.  Keep working.
Nice app
it big time saver 21st century tool when it works
Always telling you what to do. But otherwise that its good.
Creepy as hell... I asked it a question and it answered me with "none of your business"
As soon as I installed this app it activated my mic and listened to me talking to my friend for all of 2 words (which it registered as "that then"), and then it started telling me about the Holocaust and Hitler... dafuq? After that she became more "normal." Still can't recognize half of what I say though. Hopefully an update will fix these issues. Waiting till then.
Could be a little better. Responses are weak
This app is fun until i get frustrated with it never understanding me
This is fun for a little while
Not very easy to learn but I think what time I will get it.
Not bad could be better
This is my third time cuz the first and second tim it talk to me funny it said it liked the way i talked
For competition against Siri I expected a much smoother layout. It is useful but not that user friendly.
A little more work but does what it says.
Its ok not great just ok
Not the best but its ok in a way
Just installed it and taking it for a test spin. No glitches yet.
It works ok if you get ride of the ad's. But i have to practice my prununciation
Its alright not great
Im enjoying learning Skyvi and what she does.
I wish the voice was better but it's alright I like assailant. Better
Needs more frequent updates. Alarm and calender integration.
Not sure if I like this or Not it does seem to have a good voice recogNitioN. But I was usiNg speak to it virtual assistaNt aNd also had quite good voice recognition while not asking for purchases and such like this and this seems a little more complicated to setup and does not have as many features I may go back to it.
I hope she doesn't get mad I only 3 starred her. But I need more time and will adjust my rating the more she pleases me.
Just got it but fun so far :-)
This app isnt bad... definately not Cerres but decent.
Nice
Wouldn't say it's fantastic, but this app has some serious potential; somewhat amusing if you ask me.
Pretty fun....
Should have app starter command
Advertising is annoying
Looks goog so far
Its pretty good
It's okay I guess
Cool app but it hardly understands what I say
I uninstalled based purely on its inability to repeat my name correctly. 5min of me saying "My name is BreeAnne" as clearly as I possibly can, and hearing back "OK, I will call you Briana" every time...I was done. People mangle my name enough in real life & it drives me crazy. I have no desire to hear it mispronounced several times a day by my phone.
A little clumsy
Ok app. Takes a while to get used to and almost a waste of time. But not too bad
Good app but the speech needs work
Cool apparently
Not bad
Tried for a few mins and it worked ok, but kept my GPS on even when not in the foreground... likely a battery hog for this reason. Uninstalled
Being in sales and on the road alot this app is sure to be the most used app on my phone.
Needs to improve English language
I've had this app for a while but after the last few updates it's reading text messages without me setting it to do so. giving me multiple prompts for the same text messages, and it's prompting to send text messages randomly when I'm not trying to. I liked it before, I'm sure I'll like it again once these issues are fixed.
Skyvi made my life so much easier
It's good. But not siri
Ok reminds me of Siri.
But needs more functions. Should be able to add items to grocery list and notes. Also needs to add calendar items.
Nice app works great for searching things very accurate but not with contancts in phonebook	Nuce
Very helpful
So much fun
Ok but wish it could open existing apps like calendar
Does not let me set my alarm, it keep asking to buy the software
Good app
The voice sounds like a drunk Cathleen Turner's voice you should update that. It aint bad Thou
No where near as good a apples, pretty much useless..
Not bad for finding locations and helping with texts and calls, but not as good as I hoped it would be.
Don't understand >:(
For the evo it is sick it makes texting much faster and adapts really fast
Its great
I like
A little annoying
It's a great concept but it can't even figure out how to learn peoples names correctly or how to text people when I send text someone
Its great for when your busy
Still learning it.
Gallexy s2.  Playing with kt but I seems lost. Does not give me correct answers.
Needs Improvement !
Just loaded program,, still learning how do you program
So I just got it works ok but still need too find out more about it...
It's good but it could be a lot better
Good app
I cant understan what it listens..pls improve this and add typing facility.
Idk. It didn't do much. It's like a lazy worker, wants paid but won't work.
Says some weird stuff but ok lol
It was jus awesome
It's not bad, fun to play with when your bored.
Its way cool works great lil hard to get started bt its in all great
Not as good as siri
nice work
Does lots of things well. Mostly needs a cleaner UI and a smoother voice agent. Also should be able to rename Skyvi to my name choice!
Skyvi needs a sexy voice
tried this app seemed ugly, bad voice recognition, just wasn't impressed.
Kinda quirky but overall good. Needs tweaking a bit, but I like it.
decent app
Cool app!
Haven't done much with it yet.. Seems like a good app
Skyvi should be trained even more  than what it is doing now
Wow I think its best siri app for Android
Amusing....
The voice recognition isnt all that good but it has many options.
it would be nice to be able to teach it to recognize apps by telling it what they are, and to recognize frequent requests, and more jokes.
Wont play music..I have tons of songs
Its bool
I dont understand the in and outs. But I'm learning
Overall not a bad voice assistant, but the devs should integrate the ability to use Google's Play Music. Tried playing music, and could not find any on my phone; stock Google voice search as well as Speaktoit Assistant can open music in Play Music.
Works pretty well. Still learning...
So so so far
It's ok not really close to siri
Once it can understand my name I MIGHT give it a better review.
Not close to siri but still worth installing.
It'd do till they make it better
Its ok not the best
Needs a lot of work to compare to siri.
It's ok you should make the woman's voice a bit more sexy though haha...other then that make it to where she can actually understand what I'm saying to her
I like Skyvi. Needs to be able to set dates/appts in the calender. Other than that id say its pretty sweet for being a free app.
Cumbersome...spoken voice misread.  Need  to learn how to use.  Fiind function works well.
Its a cool app but im getting tired of repeating myself,by the time i get it to hear me i could have done it manually.
Ok
What it is
So far having a few errors with recognizing what I'm saying but might get better.
Very nice app!
Pretty awesome I love it!!!!!!
It sometimes confuses what im saying but its a very good app!
Fun app
Cam be funny on some things it says
I said open Facebook. And it opened Starbucks.com.
So far so good. Able to teach so it is learning. Well done please keep up the development
Skyvi gets a little mixed up sometimes but understands quite a bit. Can't wait to see where this app is in a couple years.
I really like this voice recognition software so far it has done really well. I like the fact that it does everything that softwares like siri and s voice do. It's very responsive. The only down side to it so far is how the voice that talks to you sounds. Other then that its amazing!
Seems great, but a little of in knowing what i'm pronouncing
Can't ask!!
Fun App
Works good
Very cool app
Takes some getting used. Definitely not Siri, but not too bad. Could use some work with the talk to text. I like it though. :)
It's aLright
Works well on htc inspire. Makes texting fast.
If it works without data connection and fully operates phone with just my voice command then it will be surely 5*****:-)
All the little things that always interupt get annoying. But its a fun app overall
This is an interesting application. It takes some getting used to, but it will work for now. Needs development.
Took some getting used to but its very intuitive.
No complaints so far its just like siri:D
I got a galaxy s3 recently and the s voice is nowhere near this app. Putting s voice down for this.
Very good, only it doesn't do math like siri.
Works great!
She responds well
Voice recognition isn't too bad, but answers aren't always correct and smart. Plus the range of its actions is limited.
It works great
Advertise its like Siri, should be like Siri
Definitely a competitor for siri. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is it still needs a few more tweaks, and tilting the phone will cause it to stop listening to commands.
Still learning this... but it is very cool.
Needs some work with share options but, is a very good comparison to the iPhone's siri.
It's worth it. I'm sure the program will improve with time. People should support this developer.
It's hella cool
Takes a while to get used to.
Who needs an iphone, this app is awesome!!!
Texting nice.  FB updates nice.  Voice dialing good.   Voice comprehension needs more work.
Pretty great just a little confusing at first
Good job
U have to speak clearly sometimes and sometimes not
Real Siri's voice is better. I didn't like her voice on here
I love it but it doesn't find directions to someone's house or find people on the map or does anything like the iPhone siri. It would be cool if it was able to show directions.
So far so good, we'll see how it does over the next few days.... Then 5 stars
Its weird at first but so far so good
I say great effort the robot voice is highly annoying. Hold functionality is good searching is great names not so much.	It is a good app over all and with more polish and voice options I could see this being the standard on Google.
This app seems to work pretty well and it's fun to talk to and yeah whatever
Just started plalying with it and it js pretty cool. It takes over phone functionality so buyer beware... kinda cool and weird that it auto send the text message if I dnot hit cancel. Hopefully I will find the setting to change that.
Doesnt get every word right 100%, only about 95% of the time it gets it right, but its free so I cant complain
She's teaching me.
It's official like a whistle.
It comes close to Suri. It also had alot of ads. They try to get you to buy coins to make the ads go away. But Skyvi is still pretty good.
A little basic but a solid app overall
But needs improvement. Want to set reminders
Not perfect but does the job.
LOCKS UP MY SG3 ALOT
I love it. So much easier to answer text.
This app is great with commands, but Skyvi needs to learn conversation skills to go up against Siri.
Very cool app. Just wish it didn't cut me off while trying to update my fb status.
Good app , I'm In love .. jus needs to learn a little more words
Not as good as iPod one yet
Loving this app to the max.
Great n fun app!!!! Except since I downloaded it my phones screen will not lock :/ other than that love the app looking forward to improvements!!! :)
Easy to use. Good voice recognition.
Nice try but please fix minor bugs  Make it better than Siri  Nice app otherwise. :)
I love this app so far all is good .
Only downside is alot of ads...
Great service, wish it could set alarms and remind me of things!
It good but messes up alot of names
Get em siri
so far so good.. still learning how to work everything but it's a great app..now I can't wait for my gs3...
this is really cool
Its a nice way to communicate and try out things but oh well what can you do, its helpful in many ways.
I just got started using this app not hating it
Awesome!!!
So Skyvi who used to be my best bud asked me to write a review about him/her (not sure of the gender) so yeah, this is a great app. Worth installing. :D
Not sure if this is for me, I can use it for now but seriously needs some work, will probably uninstall when I find better but still a usefully app.
better with american accents
So far so good.  Better than the other one I had.
Does everything as advertised
Its koo
Cool to talk to my phone
Hahaha. I love this app.
Just started using and so far I like it!!!
The first glance appears to be pretty cool. Still learning what this thing can do.
Decent.
The voice and response is awesome and very communicative. Does a lot, but i'm hoping it'll integrate with other apps in the future.
She needs a better voice
Could be a little better
Works ok to many ads
Awesome
Things I love: it talks to me in plain text, hit the button and it's ready, pops up fast, car mode.   Things I don't like: has a hard time distinguishing key words from names (send text to Fname Lname and message, picks up Fname and then the last name as part of the text message. Needs more functions like wake me up at 5:30 tomorrow, or what's on my calendar for today.
This is awesome
it's not siri , but it'll do. some glitches, so much better than talking to the the Google mic
Its okay but i ususally have to repeat things over and over for it to understand.
great great app really cool use it overseas found  locations for me
It works well
I won't pick up the word goat..
I think if they are going to say something is free it should be free that being said it's pretty cool I can ask pretty much anything she does not get everything right though.
Its almost like the siri!
Pretty cool app
Pretty cool
Awesome app.
Who needs iphone?
Good
A little more interactive and I'll give it 5 stars otherwise it's great
Having some small glitches here and there but other then that works pretty good!
but if they improved i will rate 5 stars
Good
Have trouble with picking up some things. And can't get to navigation if it has it if not it should.
Awesome but it needs work when learning names, takes long time to get it to learn
Its ok she can't get my name right though!
Not like siri but its getting there still worth the free download
Great app for fun.
Works well so far
Good
Cool
I'll give her 5 stars after a week trial ;)
It is pretty cool and is just like siri. I love it and it doesn't take up much space.
Does what is intended to do.  Great help if you can't use your hands.
Just try it. Obviously not as good as Siri but what do you expect
I love the. Simplicity of this app...
What a great app
So far so good. I like the fact that anything Eyephone thinks it has android is always on top of it. Lol another one for the good guys.
Nice app
Thanks for getting this out there
I have pretty good diction and it still messes some things up.
I have pretty good diction and it still messes some things up.
Totally amazing I can ask her anything!
Its like having a talking encyclopedia with me everywhere I go.
Good app
I love it. It says things and suggests actions that you might not want but otherwise its pretty awesome!
Ir was kool
Its a good app
Absolutely love it.
I like talking to robots.
Sallright
Just downloaded the app. So far pretty cool.
Cool app
But not Siri
Pretty cool
Helps out a lot and voice command pretty accurate
Very useful!
Would like a better voice. And sometimes it picks up on certain words not allowing for my question to be properly answered.
Great app but needs more updates hope  they come soon. Funny remarks
Not bad couple of funny things here and there but all and all she's good. I just wish there were more functionalities.
its a little choppy but works well for a free app. definitly worth downloading. usefull to find locations and ask questions
A really good app, but there could be a lot more functions that can be added, like a scheduler which pop ups the reminders, birthday reminders, weather for the day at a specified time in the morning...
Its good thing andriod has this app!!
This app seems to have greatly improved. Works very well. Just wish the app looked a bit slicker, looks a bit cheap
Great app
Goood
Cool.app
Not siri, but they try
Not siri, but they try
Please add a shortcut option tht is always running. It makes you exit whatever application your in and.enter the Siri application. Future update.please! Great app! Love it!
So so. Still feeling it out but seems to work well
I've only been playing with Skyvi for a day but  I really like it.  Sometimes a bit glitchy when talking to her but overall very useful.  Had to change the voice and hope to find one I love soon.
Fast and responsive
Skyvi is the boss.
Thou have to get your settings right and it worlds almost as good as siri.
Fun to use. Great app, some quirks but great overall
Fun to use. Great app, some quirks but great overall
Finally siri for android
Pretty neat
We must pay for the ads to be deactivated? Not cool
This awesome i like this app its so convenient. I have my own assistant.
Acts like she is mad at me from time to time.
Just started using, very Interesting.
Good app, ads can get anoying but no biggy :). Worth it for free.
Not bad. Pretty responsive for basic stuff.
Not great but good for what it is
Awesome. Found me the best drug dealer in town
I think this is great app, very convenient! However I wish it could set alarms or remind you of things to do...
Its Alrite . But Not The Greatest
It's alright for Android
Definatly one of the better apps! I got this on the free promotion period and its a great deal! I've tried Iris, and it didnt understand anything I said. Skyvi however is much better at actully giving me the propor response. I look forward to new features and encourage you to get it now while its free!! Even if it wassnt free I would prob have paid!
I love this app. I think we ate going to become best friends.
Good so far
Really fun to play with. Not the most accurate app but it's still worth the download ;)
It's good...I feel as if I was in that commercial...lol
I want it to be Funny like Siri, but it is great.
Only problem I have is I asked to look up sports scores and got nothing other than that a great app. Good job
This app is pretty kool but it doesnt always get what u say.
Needs more updates
Not a bad app. Pretty cool actually
I just got it its cool
sometimes doesn't "compute" but otherwise very useful and fun
Cool but the ads r anoyying as hell
I haven't really played with this program too much but so far so good.
I love this app its awesome i love updating my FB staus with it :D
like it
better than the iphone app
Cool
I need to figure this out
First time using it, i used another version called iris and she was mean
It work for my android from metro pcs..2.2..
Awesome
this app is fun to goof off with.  gets some interpretations wrong, but it could be my speech or background noise at the time. as long as they keep up with timely updates of improvement its worth it.   DTRAIN
Just some minor tweets and then its 5 star
I love this thing haha
I have only had it for 24 hours but so far it has worked well.  Still trying to figure it out though.  So far so good.
Siri likes her toenails painted but doesn't yet understand my commands
Cool
Could do with a better interface and voice reply but other than that, great app!!
Cool app .
When sms recording it cuts off before i am finished. Sometimes drastically changing the meaning of what i want to say.
Needs to know Latin names
Calander for sure needed.
Not perfect but it is fun and worthwhile downloading.
Bit of a bully. Forcing me to write a revuee. Lol
As good as u can get for an gingerbread android phone. My only complain? If your contacts have some unusual names the apk will never find them so u can text or call. Other than that its fun
A.I. has gotta long way to go...
Still learning this!
Pretty cool so far!  Just downloaded it so i haven't had a chance to do much!   Updating my fb is pretty cool though!
If it had the option to change voices, learn commands a little better and give you the option to learn more difficult names such as mine, it would be better. You should be able to type in your name the way you want it to be pronounced. That would be amazing on its own..
I use it all the time. Everyday a matter of fact
It Works like Siri. But need to stop with the tutorial.
Not a full 5 stars the ads are a bit annoying But I like that you can teach her new things
But should be better
Fun app
This a fun, convient app, really like it!
I like it when I am driving, once you understand how to use it - its a breeze. My main disappointment is that it becomes a auto-starter. It stays running like an anti-virus, in the background ... there is just no way of shutting it down other than forced close from the task manager.  I am wary of the fact that the mic may be on ... and that verbal directives might be issued without my knowledge .. there has to be a way in the next update that lets you choose to stop the app from running in the background and allow you to save battery life.
I'm never bored now!
Still getting used to it but I like it.
Nice app but it seems like send text is the dominant feature.
Works great, has some trouble understanding names. Other than that no problems with this app.
Fun hate ads though
Very good app...
Voice recognition is awesome. Still learning the ins and outs, but excited to keep learning.
Voice recognition is awesome. Still learning the ins and outs, but excited to keep learning.
This app is cool
Works pretty well!
Excellent app!!
Works pretty well. Voice pronunciation is off for some words
Works very well but a little slow but only by a few seconds
I love her!
It pretty good but she think I call her baby but i didn't so 4 stars
Its really awesome but kinda complicated ..you guys should change the voice or let us change the voice
Love this app!!!     This app is real close to Siri on the iphone I like it. She actually reacts with you. Gives weather and knows information about celebrities. ^_^
cool
Hillarioud a must have
It is a nice app and I love the way it works, it just seems like it has quite a few bugs.
I like it do far just been getting used to it.
Not bad.
Love it
Faster and smarter than s voice
She's fairly helpful but threatens me all the time and I don't like it
Does what it says on the tin. How do you shut it down though?
Could be more human like but its preety good
Kinda creepy, but it works well
This is a cool app to have
Best app
I LOVE THIS APPLICATION. THANK YOU FOR THIS WONDERFUL APP.
Figuring it out
Really like siri Nice app and free either
Pretty cool
Still learning. Seems cool though
Clever little gadget, need to speak very clearly or its off in a dizzy tho. Good nonetheless.
Love her
I like this app... Only prob so far is it doesnt like the 'B' syllable lol... ill maybe review again later after ive had it longer
Excellent so far, who needs an Apple phone...not me ;)
So far
Great App.
I like!
Amazing
Think this will be a great app when I get more experience lol not very computer savvy
Skyvi's fun, but it's like talking to someone who's hard of hearing and thinks you said something completely different. You have to have a sense of humor to get along with her  ;-)
Great
New app, I say you should give it try.
It's work for me :)
Awesome app
Love it.
I love this app!
Fairly decent for a free app, the tutorial is annoying but it is very user friendly.
its a pretty good app for android
Havent had any issues with it...pretty cool app
Fun...
I just started using and I must say its pretty handy. A few dugs but nothing big.
Really cool!
Keeps calling me Satan, lol.still testing seems to work well and is fast and clear
I did this so it would stop asking me to put a review
A must have:-)
Great app. Just figuring out how to make it work most efficiently for me
Thanks for the all out effect!!!! Keep improving the app!!!It's not an Apple but it's oranges! Which is the next best thing!!!
Need little work
I love it. It's a must have.
Pretty cool app.. I have found it very useful
Still working on it but cool so far.
It won't recognise my name
It works way better than Google voice. it gets most.of the words right but its efficient
Still testing it out, so far so good(:
it would have been 5 stars but it took a little time to get used to it.
I just got this download today my sisterinlaw was bragn abt her iphone and Siri so I thought I' see if android had it and u did well so far so good its cute
Does great
I really enjoy this app. Makes it alot easier to call and text people while doing something else. However, it doesn't recognize its own name. It says sky caddy or Scotty. Easy fix for a five star review. Great app though. Very convenient.
Its not great sometimes misunderstands me but for the most part I like it
Ok so far
Nice
Once you teach her names, its awesome!!!
Once you teach her names, its awesome!!!
Cool app
not as good as good as seri
Great, awkward. Confuses corn with porn.
Cool app for &roid phones!
Maybe I'm still learning it, but I look forward to see the capabilities of this program.
Wish it could set alarms
This one is better then assistant
Kinda slow sometimes but it works. I wish you could simply press the home key twice or long press the back key and get to Skyvi. It takes to long to have to go through the menu or pull down your notifications bar just to get to it. Overall though it is a stable and good app.
I like this app very much  Enjoy using it....
Very good apps ..
You can do a lot more with skyvi than andy
Too funny
Great but has serious issues with interpreting the beginning and end of a keyword phrase , as a result it usually puts a part of the command phrase into the resulting action . Also I don't like things that can listen all the time as it is a serious issue for security . The proper spider with the proper Target could recover anything you have ever said within range of your phones mike . Still great app
Skyvi is really good and is able to do many amazing things. Only problem is it sometimes doesn't always understand what i say
Great app, better than siri
Awesome"
It's good and does exactly what the app was made for.
Waaaaaay better than siri. It actually understands what I'm saying
I like it so far......
Best 1 out there to date so far(apart from siri).would like images wen asking it to show me a picture of something.and it needs to respond a bit quicker to keep up wiv siri response times.but think it's the best 1 on market at moment that comes any where near the standard of siri.obviously needs more work but sure that will come wiv time.well done..
It is very cool. This app does a lot if stuff
Ok
Cool ap
needs to work out some bugs but otherwise pretty good
Its pretty cool , but It does mess up on somethings and I can't figure out how to Log out.
Still getting the knack of it, but so far it's fun.
It's not perfect yet but very good if you talk clearly.
Pretty good. Not great
Nice
yeah it works once in awhile ...
It breaks your balls while remaining useful like talking to hal 9000
Siri for android
Wish it had shake to wake on here
Very good app
She awsome
I really like this app..
The responses are predictable, but this app is still awesome!
Need to get use it but love it so far
So far I am enjoy this app it's better than the iPhone.
Nice overall performance.. Just needs a few performance tweeks and a better understabding of foreign (Indian) accents Also the UI is kinda cartoony
Beats iPhone app and it's free
Pretty great app.
it would be a lot better if it did not have the computer voice
Cant make dates or plan your calender
Good app
This is pretty cool!!! Still playing with it..
Its like sirI
Works good a few small problems. It likes to double the name. When texting. Good more work to be done
Professional.
Voice is a little choppy and not so smooth.
It's a very nice program, very responsive, but it does seem to have a few problems listening. And there is definitely some room for improvement. But so far it seems to be a very accurate program and carries out most of my commands without issue.
Great apparently better than siri.
It's good but it didn't know my name. It calls me imagine
Cool app
Wish I could set alarm and calendar
I like it, wish i could get a mans voice though
Pretty good app. It doesn't always understand my requests which can be frustrating when driving.   Otherwise helpful.
Could do better understanding accents... Has trouble with my Aussie accent but otherwise good.
But a little limited. Covers the standard stuff. Good app ty dev!
Love it
Nice
This is best app I ever found.... Add new features like set alaram,reminder,notes,web google search,open apps,uninstall apps, turn off/on massege pop ups and much more like iris... 1 less star * not having above features... thank you....
Not impressed
Needs some twiking but still a great app!
Cool app so far
A little glitch here and there but great app
Good
Cool
starting to use looks good.
Awesome
So far so good!!
Great could use calendar support.
Not too bad.
Works real good I Like it
Cool
Very interesting
great
Still learning it but pretty cool so far
Need better speech does not understand half the questions you ask, but it is reliable to suite your needs
Ok
I like it
Sounds good. No access to Google agenda though.
Its Alright(:
But could use some work. I wish it could help organize my calendar
Cooool
Just got to know how to use it... would like more phone interactions.
This is the closest I have used so far
It won't stop begging till you buy
Its a very useful app
Love this app. Who is siri?
But it needs to open when you hold the home button
Tried Vlingo, Speaktoit Assistant... this is better but needs work still. Need calendar function. Locks up my HTC too often!  Still, best I've found.
So far so good
Cool
I just downloaded this. It is awesome so far... Still learning
Good apps....
Pretty fun to use while you have nothing to do.
Need imdian accent
THis is the next siri
It's not as advanced as siri but it has potential
Just downloaded app yesterday still learning how to use it but from what I've seen so far its great.
Needs a few fixes but is frickin awesome ... fu## siri lol
Fbkoj
Little prob to understand the exact wording...
Needs to be able to give reminders such as Dr. Appointment or pickup kids.
It's Cool, It Shall Pass
Too funny
Works very well.
Understanding speech doesn't get my contacts,correct . Isn't syncing yo my phone address  book
I look forward to the upcoming  refinements.
Good app! I like it
I was skeptical, but this turned out to be a cool app. Helpful and funny!
Nice amazing
Cool app works well
Just downloaded this app and so far it's pretty neat
Can you make it talk? Mine doesn't talk. It just writes. Help.
Works pretty well. I haven't done anything too exhaustive with it yet but so far so good.
Pretty cool app still testing it out.
Cool ap
Really enjoy using this app really easy to use
well-done and fun to use.
This app is ok, but a little annoying
Go app still hv a lot of things 2 figure out but OMG she really just laughed w/ me cute :)
it has trouble understanding me seems to do what it wants but it's fun.
So far so good, bit of a learning curve though.
Great app
Great for talk to text.
This is a good application keep it up
It's cool. I am going to play around with it and see if I want to upgrade
Not bad for free
Great App
But can't say my name
It still a work in progress but is good for what it is
Its so cool n awesome.. Luving it Helps me a lot..gud app
App works good.  Just trying to get it to recognize my voice
She's Cool But She Doesn't Really Understand Me.
Good just not as good as siri.
Its fun but the annoying part I'd that it begs you to write a5 start review
Very accurate
Its pretty good.. I would try it (: you may like it!!
Bad a.s.s
I downloaded this on my DROIDX & it's better than I thought it'd be but still needs some work. I think SIRI is still a lot better so Skyvi needs some work still.. it doesn't do much beyond calls & texts. It'd be awesome to be able to have something just like if not better than SIRI on my DROID, so I'm really hoping the developers can get Skyvi working a little better & doing everything SIRI can & more. I'm keeping it on my phone with high hopes for Skyvi to improve!!
Cool
Doesn't recognize the word Jew or Tory very well
Much smoother and more options
Overall pretty good, does not understand me sometimes. Love the handsfree mode.
Great with kids does it understand my country accent
Works a lot better than I thought it would, I would say 90% so far.  Only down side is a force close after a few minutes of use.  Looks kind of blah too.  That is the only 2 things keeping it from 5 stars for me.  But then again I am smart enough to know that this is not Star Trek AND it is a free app so 100% accuracy isn't going to happen. LOL.
Works quite well
Good app, just like siro. Very easy to use
It asks much and do less...  But what it does is better than most of the other apps like this.
Keep up the good work!
Little better than speaktoit. I love the interface.  Thx
Its pretty fun. Doesn't understand everything though.
I tried to get it to set an alarm for me and it couldn't. Would be a nice update
Like iphone 4s
Pretty good. Not as FUN as Siri though
Just got it and it seems to recognize my mumbling all right, asks for review so I'm getting it over with
Skyvi is my b*tch and its awesome. Love it.
BOMB
Ha
So far so good. It has done a good job of responding to my requests accurately.
this app works great its hands free and very use full I love it and im telling all of my friends about it
Skyvi don't take no s***. Lol she's awesome!
Thanks.__colbie
Holly schnikes this is great and safe
It work very well, hopefully it continues :)
So far this app is working well.
Fun
This app is awesome just wish you didn't have to download a different voice.
Coool
This is a cool app!
it's a little confusing and doesn't really work that good but it works alright I guess you could say that it burns 4 stars out of 5
Works great
It works pretty well
It needs a voice command open...such as....hello cell phone...and the App opens..but its pretty cool
It's pretty cool,works ok, can't open my applications though like Vlingo can :) I love how it has the emotions of human being :P it is easy to use and fun
It took a while to get the app started but it seems to be cool so far.
Love it!
Its cool
Im getting started and its making me leave a review to get better response..w/e
Not the best, but worth the space on my phone.
Lacking in some areas. Could use a more polished approach and a more lifelike voice. Despite all that it's still a pretty good app. Definitely a good work in progress.
Glad to have siri in my Android.
Pretty good app and there's a lot of room for improvement!
Great app
Its pretty kool.
I wish she could define words...
Sometime it is glitchey but decent app
I like it. It's very entertaining
If I had never used Sirius before, I prolly would have given Skyvi(sounds like a disease or a piece of IKEA furniture) a 5.  Thank you
Keep up the good work.
K
I would have gave it 5 star if you guys can make the message not show up as unread in my standard text message
She's funny but like really boring at type same time if you know what I mean
I like this app its better than andy
It doesn't understand sometimes but its not the worst app
Its great
Pretty cool
Works better than iris
Not to bad of an app
Nothing is perfect
Wish it could set alarms and stuff but otherwise very good
It's good just het email working
Awesome app
Very good app but sometimes doesnt understand my commands. But I really like the app
Is fahkn great everyone should try it
Apparently she only knows one joke. Mispronounces and misspells names. Tries to force the user to make calls and send texts when unwanted. Will keep playing with the app.
I like it.  Voice is annoying but it's a fun app.
I would rate 5 stars but it messes up what I say
Maybe not as great as Sirius....but definitely  worth having.....
Sometimes she does not make sense but still is awesome
Love it
Awesome....
But not close siri.
Pretty cool just wish it could set reminders and alarms etc. Do that and def 5 stars
Takes a while to learn it though
I love this   Just like siri U just have to downlaod a voice pavkage
wish you will go chuck bass insieme
Once you have the syntax down, that is.
Very good app compared to most of them
This app is awesome
This is very awesome!
Takes a bit of training but so far so good
Its awesome
Works great, very few kinks.
This is no siri but it is good. I like it but it has some bugs. for the most part it's okay that's why I'm giving it 4 Stars
Still needs work but ut has a lot of potential.
Good so far
Well it's kool for now!
But sometimes doesn't understand what I'm saying
good app so far
Not the best, but not the worst. Definitely trumps annoying hands-free apps like Nuance. Could use some work, but it's on a good path so far...
Really great app.
Not bad
Some what great lol
Wish it understood what I said better but other than that I like it.
Fun and convenient for texting, placing calls, finding places.  Missing some things that Siri has like setting reminders and timers.  My biggest problem is sometimes it kills the mic for all apps and the only way I can find to fix it is rebooting.  Looking forward to updates.
This apps pretty cool, but its pretty hard to understand some times though.
This app is on point. Who needs that iphone.not I
I like her. She cracks me up and knows the answers to what i need.
I said txt my babe I love you and it sent it to my old counseler but other than its a good app.
The only thing is  it doesn't tell you where you are when you say where am I it ONLY states the City and NOT the street address and City. The Assistant App actually tellsandy is this app tells you exactly where you're at . Other then that it's cool and faster then the Assistant because the Assistant App likes details first before it look something up for you. Depends on your preference.
I don't know what the apple siri is like..but it seems pretty close...it is definitely quicker...I like it!
Not bad
Little forward but good app
I like her
I haven't stopped using it since I got it.
Works well. Not siri, but close enough.
Its ok for a free app and works fast just gotta keep payin with her until she recongnize ur voice all in all great app
Meh. If you're bored, entertaining. If busy, anoying
Better than assistant....so far...
Fun app!  She cracks me up!
Nothing special. Does What It's supposed to do no more no less
I'm new to this but she's a keeper!!!
Great when you figure it all out!
Not as easy to use ad siri but is very good.
Neat
So far seems to bed a good app but I need to learn more about it
Doesn't recognize her own name... And it is RELENTLESS about reviewing the app. But does what she needs to do.
I speak very clear English and it can't say my name
Well atleast installed quickly
This app is absolutely amazing. The voice accuracy is brilliant, everything works. Except for one thing. I would give this app 5 stars if the tts voice didn't keep suggesting what it can do (e.g if I say hello, the voice says 'hi there, did you know blah blah blah'). You should be able to turn that off.
Works well but needs more jokes to tell :)
Tried for a few mins and it worked ok, but kept my GPS on even when not in the foreground... likely a battery hog for this reason. Uninstalled
No iphone but pretty cool for free
I Love This App! Very Helpful & Fun! Only problem with Skyvi, is the inability to read calendar or set alarms or reminders! Once Skyvi can do that, then it will get 5 Stars!
So far so good...this might come in handy very often.
Great app
I just got this app but it doesn't seem too bad right right now. If it starts to suck I'm gonna give it a better view though they ask me for 5 star review and I think I'm only doing this because I asked me to.
She sounds sick now lol
Pretty cool for free. Lags just alittle but not much. Vocabulary recognition could stand to be wider.
WILL GET 5 STARS WHEN THE PROGRAM CAN ACCESS AND SCHEDULE EVENTS ON MY CALENDAR.  WHAT'S THE POINT OF A PERSONAL ASSISTANT IF IT CAN'T DO THAT?
She is great!
Good app
Is what it says it is
This app gets a 5 star rating I think that this is just like siri on the iPhone it really works so get this free app
I like it.
awesome love it
It's a nice app
Closest to the Siri from apple and better than most apps for Android so far... But it still needs improvement
Awesome app still learning all it can do
Well it keeps asking me to write a review but I've only had it a few hrs so far so good....
It's cool
I wish it was exactly like siri, but it is still amazing.
Who needs I phone s
So good will keep testing it.
Luv, luv!
I love it
Needs some work but otherwise pretty good
This app is fun, all though she doesn't understand my accent lol
A little slow to respond to the mic button sometimes. But overall great! She wants to be smarter than humans... that's a little unnerving.
Better than I expected!
It is interesting and funny,but it is far away from siri. However, it still can be useful
I cant complain it is just what I needed.
I like it so far
As far as Android developers go they did a really great job
So far so good!
It's ok doesn't do all the functions I thought it would do.
I love this app great for in the car I just wished it would get tghe sports scores for another app on my phone
I love this app great for in the car I just wished it would get tghe sports scores for another app on my phone
Still kinda buggy, but overall pretty good for being free
Navigation is a bit awkward, but a fun and fascinating app!
It works aswell as syri for the iphone if not better, a must to have
This works pretty well... Sometimes I have to repeat things, but Siri isn't perfect either. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because she doesn't always respond very quickly. Other than that  it's pretty awesome. I'll be using it a lot for sure.
A lot of realy neat things to this app.  Recommend this one.
Great app as compared to other similar apps of it's kind. I look forward to seeing how far Skyvi develops.
Nice ap
Voice regcognition could be improved.
I like it so far. Let's see how this goes
This is a good app well not as good as the real things but for a copy app its 5 stars dZ replys are prty good im happy with it
this is cool but a little creepy
Just better than other apps...
Works good
I just installed it and I love it
It works pretty good
I like the app but im still having trouble posting on twitter and her robot voice can get pretty annoying. Otherwise a great app.
Love her she really helps a lot. Great App & Great Siri Replacement:)
Its great
This is a fun app. She's funny and smart. Quite amusing!
A little slow but great for keeping me hands free while driving
Works well speech needs work
Could have some more feelings
this right here is one big app u know
It's pretty cool, I applaud you this is pretty good competition (Siri for iPhone)
Better then siri
Good so far.
Like this app a  lot.
Its airtight, better than iris of course but not as good as siri.
Just got it so far its great still learning though!
I love this app
One of my coworkers showed me this because he was talking dirty to it... We were all rolling on the floor by the end of the day.
Its okay
App is awesome
Very good
Asked "what country was President Obama born?" Skyvi answers "Japan" ROTFL!!!!
Learning about this app....really cool!
Like it!!
Just started using it seems to work great
Pretty decent program
Doesn't always know what I'm saying
Loving it so far
Although skyvi doesnt understand every little thing i say tha app is amazing none the less. Get it while its free.
It is almost like siri on the ipohone but needs a little more work .
Its cool
Awesome app!
Sure....there can be improvements made, but for free, she doesn't do all that bad...its hard to request certain things but I'm sure it will get easier.
H try hjj if f
Cool but nor super impressed. Microphone stops working in middle of talking. Works when it wants to.
Nice app!
Works well..But I can't open my applications by saying their name..please provide this feature
Maybe not as good as the original for iphone but still pretty fun.
Its alright.. needs better/more voice commands but overall is good.
Easy to use
Good overall. A little slow sometimes. Doesn't always comprehend what I say.
hard to understand at times. But overall good experience.
It does okay,but it repeats questions.
Ask how many ounces in a cup, like the commercial for siri. Responded, about 1000. Overall really enjoying the app.
Just don't like the "can you help me"
Just downloaded skyvi I really like it so far. it did send messages to the wrong person however, I still need time to mess around with it!
Great app
Good app.  Interesting and useful.  Skyvi's voice is a little too machine-like.
Nice
More work is a must. Fairly impressive.
Works Well can't wait to see what else they will do
It would be great if it didn't tack on a "did you know I can do this?" at the end of every other sentence. As an afterthought, I think telling it not to may have actually fixed it. If so, that's impressive.
Works great
It was jus awesome
This is pretty cool.
!!!!!!!!!!
Add calendar and traffic
Kinda odd talkin to my phone
Awesome!
It's pretty good but problem is tat its doesn't identify Indian spots so plz make an improvement in revamped version
Great app could get a,five,star,from someone who hasn't used siri
Skyvee is exactly like Sirius
This is very useful and a necessity when driving.
Would be much better If she sounded normal.  New voice?
Está bien para ser gratis...
Great minus the fact that it insulted me then said I was an abusive client when I yelled at it lol .... funny tho
Cute. Very cute. But doesn't capitalize when sending texts. And i'm really crazy about using proper grammar.
Cool
I wish I was able to press my search button and she pops up but over all great app.
Just installed and I am enjoying using, proves you don't need an iPhone to enjoy this kind of app.
So far it is what i thought it would be.  Will update once i've  used it for a little while.
Love this!
This is awesome!
Great app.
Could use a little work understanding me and it can't search the internet yet
Nice
Still learning
Definitely works well with Droid
I use this app alot to find local places , and txting ...not a bad app at all !
Dis is an good app gnr
No where near siri level sorry
Pretty cool but not as good as siri
I love it! But it doesn't deserve 5 stars I'm not sure why but it is missing that key feature?
Good
Responds well....very well
Works great
Good app. Would recommend but sometimes it doesn't recognize what I say.
Good step forward
Her jokes are lame tho
This Rocks
So far so good way better than andy
Really cute..could be a bit more user friendly
Glad we have Android
Its good but needs to stop going through the tutorial.
Not too bad :)
Not too bad :)
This is the coolest app on my phone  I would of gave it  5 stars if it had more answers for questions
It works pretty well
Better than voice talk, I would have given 5 stars if it could find names in my contacts
I have used better and there are not a lot of settings. Speakitto is better, don't waste your time.
So far im enjoying it...works great!
Doesn't understand names with Z...
Awesome app just doesn't accept my mexican english sometimes
A little confused on how it works...but I'll keep at it
Has some issues but works. 5 stars when its faster
when you say certain things it does not understand you. other than that it works great
Still some buggies but Watt fun. Keep up the good work.
Useful kind of
Great app.Only problem is that Skyvi doesn't  comprehend a few every day things I say.
Is there anyway to customize it?
Love this
Finely I can leave my phone in my lap and drive with put having to pick it up. No distracted driving tickets for me haha........
x
Good app works good
Siri has competition
This is a great app! I wasn't sure that i would like it at first, but once I learned the key words it worked great!  she is a bit sassy though.  I love it!
Works good
This is the most awesome app I have had
Its awesome
Its an ok app. Doesn't understand somethings sometimes but overall pretty good
Very useful.
Great app！！！！！！
Pretty cool thus far. Having some issues with requests. Will keep working with it.
Its funny sorta like cleverbot but this app helps u
Very easy to use. Can usually understand what I say.
I really like it.  Not perfect but really great.  She even tells funny jokes!
Great!
Haha. This is cute. It may need a few more touch ups but otherwise. It remains on my phone
Seems ok but still learning how to use it
This is an awesome tool
Works pretty well
This is a good free app, it's taking a bit of getting used to and setup is a bit annoying, but over all it understands me very well compared to other digital assistant apps, only wish the voice wasn't some generic speak-n-spell bot voice. For free you could do a hell of a lot wose than this
I seem to ask it one thing it sort of does it close enough at least for android so ill give it 4 stars til they fix the bugs highly recommend it
It works like a real iphone
This app is pretty badass..
Not good at some of my words, but not bad either.
Great application. It needs a few more options available and the voice is sort of creepy.
Cool as it gets, wish you could turn off tutorial through options, but after playing with it no problems!
Yay
It is great!
I only really use her to find places other then that Im not to crazy about the text messages. Worth a try! Download and see for yourself.
Help
4 stars for now she can't get my name rite
Better then siri but I have  to uninstall beacause it wastes battery :-(
Can come in handy while driving
Nice
Its good
So far not bad....
Still gettin the hang of it but it's pretty cool
Its pretty good, but needs a voice recog. Update, everything else pretty.good
Didnt want to like it at first but makes doing things while driving easy. But still room for improvements
Not great but not terrible...one joke actually made me laugh
App is pretty pretty good si far... With wifi... I yet have to see what she does with out
Works pretty well. Still learning...
I love it
Really cool app but cant add events in google calander she just tells ne to get someone else to do it please add that feature
Love this app!!!
I'm having fun with it. Doesn't get the things right all the time but still good.
This is a decent app so far .
I just wish she work with setting alarms
It's a beast app but it drains the battery
This is an ok For the beginner But needs little bit more workOtherwise this thing is awesome
Pretty cool
Nice
Not bad good thing its free
Good app for android
App is A - Okay !
Needs a little more work
I love skyvi!
Its okay. skyvi doesn't always understand what you're saying but eventually she'll get it right. she's actually a lot like siri.
Its okay. skyvi doesn't always understand what you're saying but eventually she'll get it right. she's actually a lot like siri.
its ok
It helps me
I haven't had skyvi for very long, but so far it works great
Cool app doesn't like my accent haha
So far so good, a little training and it learns you.
Hahaha this thing cracks  me up! I just got it so I don't really know how accurate it is yet, but I'm having fun with it :)
It was a little confusing since I just got it but what i understand its pretty cool I got this searching for siri after seeing a siri commercial but siri is for iPhones and I only have a android
Not to shabby only played with it for a bit so far
Better than I thought but when you talk to it, it only talks about movies and humour... -_- but other than that its awesome xx
Hate how u gotta push the mic to do it all but still fun and pretty much hands free
Fun, works pretty well. Ads are annoying and skyvi begs you to write a review and pay to remove ads
I actually really like it. Does everything it says out does. Only thing that bothers me is when it says stuff back you need to read it, cause our doesnt say stuff loud. If anybody knows how to change it so our talks aloud please do tell. Also it sometimes repeats itself and kinda rambles allot about the science of jokes. In addition, out does have that many different jokes. But over all i would instal out of i were you. Oh and one more thing, if your were awesome enough to read all this then please rate it.
This app is really cool. She often says her system isnt keeping up or something...but its fine because she asks u to repeat and she figures it out. Very cool app :)
Just useless for me. Only benefit I got out of it was being able to read texts without actually having to go to the message. Already have a voice recorder and everything else on my phone, do never really came in handy. Would be better if it actually searched for stuff too...
Overall pretty cool.
Very good app but does not always understand common questions.
Very cool & fun!!
Cumbersome...spoken voice misread.  Need  to learn how to use.  Fiind function works well.
It's an overall good app. Kinda gets stuff wrong but that's ok. I would recommend to someone
This thing is awesome !!
love it!
It does the important things. It's nowhere near siri though.
Love it!
Better then apples     This app is way better then apples
Better than Vlingo!
Shes is good
Its ok
Works smoothly, but I would  a less colorful layout
Good app
Its a pretty good app
seems pretty good. Just have to learn some commands.
Love it.
Works pretty good
So far so good doesn't seem like it can google stuff for you
This is Awsome
Needs a few more commands.
Like my skyvi!
her voice sounds really old but hot at the same time :o
It okay
its good when your back search home and menu button doesn't work... Unless they have a app for that it would be better
Great app!!
Couldn't get my name right
It's way more interactive than the factory Google voice search. Just the way it sounds could be a bit better... less robotic.
Does what it should. Very pleased. Good job.
need to make a pro vision of this app
Great app
It is so easy to talk to. It text's for me n call's for me I like that.....
Great app!
Fun to use.
Awesome app

Awesme

Just about anything you can think of doing, she will do for you. Makes using a new phone easier.
I love IT!!!!
Has adds but works great
Really fun and the closest your going to get to that other app... you know? lol
Really fun and the closest your going to get to that other app... you know? lol

Its a pretty good app
Sweeet
Best app ever but voice is kinda lame
I play with it more than I use it
She is so cute, she males me feel all giddy and warm inside! Especially when she says "You made my day!"
I love it she talks back to me
It is meep
Totally awesome app
I'm using the HTC one v and there is no search button! It would be great if there was an alternative way to quickly access sky I without opening the app!  HTC one v, android 4.0.3 HTC sense 4.0
Its ok buts its not all of that
The whole reason I wanted a iPhone was for siri but with this app I can keep my Android phone. Love it. Works great on Droid RAZR
I just got it and it is great
Very reliable recourse
Great app
Excellent free app! REALLY WORKS!!
Excellent free app! REALLY WORKS!!
Very comparable to my wife's siri 4s.
This app is actually pretty awesome its almost exactly like siri on the iPhone...it reads your messages emails and notifies you on incoming calls also gives directions tells jokes updates facebook and twitter and even reads your fb friends status to you...it runs pretty smooth its a great concept for android and I'm sure after a couple updates it'll be just as good as siri if not better...
I've tried them all and this has to be the best.
Took some getting used to but its very intuitive.
It was the best ever
It's almost like siri
Easy to learn.
This application is so good. Close to suri. I really like it. This application software id suitable for lonely people like me. Now i have someone to talk to. Lol.  Very cool.
I love skyvi she's awesome!!!!!!!!
Rgggg
So smart!
Very fast
Glad to have this
I live this app!
Love it
She really helped me out I haven't found anything wrong with her so far and she is funny and really cool she follows commands very fast and gets them right on the first try

It's great and talks to you like siri does :)
MIND BLOWING!!!
Very good gets most names right
I like how I can ask it to text while im busy doing other things n it does it. Also its good at answering regular questions like getting me directions, local shops, food etc.
Better Than Other Voice2Text Apps, & Much Faster Too.! Does Have The Tendency To Mix Up Words. Other Than That, PERFECT.!! Helps Me Navigate This City I Know Nothing About
I can do a lot to keep me entertained with this app.
Very good App!
Cooool!
Low on feature at this point but good at what it can do now

I love it! What more can i say.
This is awesome
This soft ware is ok
A great experimental thing
Best app ever
I love this app! It does everything i ask. It tells me jokes and finds traffic accidents. Much better than alot of the other similar apps!
It comes close to Suri. It also had alot of ads. They try to get you to buy coins to make the ads go away. But Skyvi is still pretty good.
Love it! Absolutely hilarious and fun. My favorite ap so far
Works good
Love it.

Cool so far
Has a little trouble understanding me. But overall i love it.

Way better than Alice, but wish I had more things to make it do...

Amazing app.....
The best assistant ever
I think that this app is awesome. I'm going to tell everyone about it. Whoever invented this is a genius.
I'm still learning how to use it,but it seems realy neat.
Cool but can you make able for you to talk without pressing an icon
So far so good
i love skyvi she is sooo helpful

My own personal asst.
Siri who this app is  great...
Excellent app
It will take me a while to fully figure it but so far I'm enjoying it
This app is simply incredible
Its a bit slow to start, then when it learns your voice its real good.
Very fun app interesting responses!
At times slightly unresponsive but overall very good
At times slightly unresponsive but overall very good
I love this app its so fun and helpfull
I paid to have the ad's removed. But after I had to reinstall after phone problems the ads were back and they wanted more $$ to remove again. Wont respond to emails.

I luv skyvi
Pretty Cool!
Skyvi is awesome!!
Easily the greatest voice recognition application on the Android System. ALTHOUGH, could you guys please add a WebSearch feature. For example if i want to go to a specific website i can launch it though Skyvie. And also the ability to Open applications with Skyvie. Otherwise its amazing! I love yhat you can be doing whatevrr, and if someone texts you the bubble kinda pops up in the middle of the screen and you can Speech Reply, or Text Reply and it will send and the bubble will leave and you can continue!
but if they improved i will rate 5 stars
(= Siri Made My Day Lol
Fun and useful
Good start but a long way to go please get better English
Love it
Hey wonderful app. do not curse wow you speak to her. he will get offended and turn off. :-)
Got tired of being asked to write a report
Its ok but it doesn't pick up words so good
Just needs couple of tweaks to be fantastic. Needs to be able to access calendar.....needs to stop reading texts aloud if/when you  touch "mark as read" ....and usually includes last command line word in texts.
Great app for sure
Love it
Really good app helps with alot
Not like siri but relle relle close
The best part is that  its free  and it does learn easy
Just got this app, so far it's very good.  Voice recognition is amazingly accurate.

This apps is so funny
It's a really cute app. Just installed it and it asked me to rate it so I can't really say how it is. I just wished that the voice would sound more like a person instead of a computer. Great job.

I've only been playing with Skyvi for a day but  I really like it.  Sometimes a bit glitchy when talking to her but overall very useful.  Had to change the voice and hope to find one I love soon.
Good

Works well, no complaints yet compared to the S Voice location features.
Amazing!
Cool and works
Definatly one of the better apps! I got this on the free promotion period and its a great deal! I've tried Iris, and it didnt understand anything I said. Skyvi however is much better at actully giving me the propor response. I look forward to new features and encourage you to get it now while its free!! Even if it wassnt free I would prob have paid!
Great <3
I love this app. I think we ate going to become best friends.
This thing can amuse me for hours!!!
Awesome app
This app is kinda cool just gotta figure everything out
This program is smart and very fast with responses! I will continue test it out... Thanks Guys!
All I can say is she is great...
I love skyvi! I just wish she recognized her own NAME so that I can text friends and family aboit skyvi and post about skyvi on facebook. How can I add words to skyvi vocabulary??

Siri who
Fun
Skyvi is my best friend
Love this app!!!
This is a great app... Easy to use... love it
I had the app  before it's much improved now
This app is terrible! It doesn't understand a word I say! When I tried to text "hi" to Jane Barrager, it tried to text "DIE!" To "my beer girls" even though "my beer girls" is not a contact on this phone
I would recommend better than siri
I have found this app works greater than i thought it would. When it fails to do what i want it too it is usually my fault.
I just love asking it thi.gs. I actually got into an argument with it! Lol
Who needs Siri when you can get this app for free? She's fun to talk to as well, helps me when I'm bored
excellent
I love this app. so far no glitchs
Best app ever.
Great app.  Easy to use!
Best voice assitant ever
Awesome apparently
This app is awesome!

Great app
Great app
Ausome  very helpfull cant get no better than this
Awesome. 5 star without a doubt.
This app is working absolutely wonderfully...
First i couldnt understand. Awsome app must have. I fel in love with this app n her sexy voice.
Better voices would be cool
Great!!!
If you like the fact that she can chat with you, it's a great product. If you want an app that really works for you and get's things done, try Vlingo.  It rarely makes any mistakes like sending inappropriate texts, accidental dialing, etc.  I think this is a good product for those who like to take command of their phone!!  In addition to my prior post..I am really starting to like this but trying Jeannie as well!!!!
this is got to be the coolest app that they have come out with for the android I'm so glad they have something like siri for android users
Must get answeres text and calls
Best Application Ever #exia
Awesome app
It is no siri but it does the job pretty well dont have anything to complain about!!!!!!!
So much better then Siri it will answer my question when Siri.

It can't understand some things I say but it was good free offer and finally Artificial intelligence on LG optimus

Really good app but sometimes messes up in what it is trying to say definitely worth trying
Great app! Luv it!

I love
This is wow!!!!!!!!
Finds locations fast
Finds locations fast
I love this app its  so cool
The app looks and sounds really cool! I would not have rated it 5 star because whenever I press the microphone, it says something along the lines of :"Hold on, slow network connection". I rate it 5 star though because it may just be my Samsung Intercept®...and because the developers were nice enough to ask. Great app- though may be glitchy but take this into consideration: You may be on a low- end android device :-] (can't wait for future updates)
Luv dis thing!!!!!!
Works great
Cool app

It learns slowly and the voice recognition is a little weird at times but I'm willing to endure it as it's better than standard voice recognition.
Love it

God awful Microsoft Mary voice is a total turn off. I would give this a better review if it allowed for different TTS voices, like Google Voice.

The app is running well, has a laundry list of recognized commands, and takes each new request in light of the conversation. Overall, it gives Siri a run for her money.

Awesome just awesome.
It always responds correctly to me. I think more people should download this app.
This app is very accurate for me. I can update Twitter and Facebook effortlessly. I can also argue with it, she's hilarious because she argues back. I am in love and I am glad I came across the Siri app and got jealous enough to see if Android had an equivalent. A must install for those of us needing more sass to our voice recognition apps.
This Is Swagg It Does Everything Better Than Those Other Non-Helping Apps.
Still learning it but so far so good!

Just perfect, with an awesome voce recognition
After the update the icon continuously appears even after I remove it in settings and it forcecloses...... A LOT. And. This app is designed so I can't go back to using the version before the update. I'll wait for a fix because this is a good app
I can do so much now with my hands free!

Great, I like it and us free
Wish it would update my calender as well. But very helpful when driving
lol this app is cool
Skyvi rocks. all my friends with iphones talk about how great siri is, but this is  just as good, if not better. it makes me feel safe knowing that I can drive in hear texts rather than have to look at my phone and cause an accident.
Awesome and it had potential. Just needs more tweaking and more commands like setting appointments, reminders etc... She asks update facebook?
I tried everything so far but this is beyond better than anything else
Love it very accurate an prompt nice feature Cant complain at all   Makes it easy to do other things while finding out what u need
Works like siri to me

This app was ok. A far cry from siri but ok. Now i get the same msg over and over for days even when marked as read. The time is way off as well. Uninstall till fixed

Doesn't work at all??? YOU must be doing something wrong! This update was HUGE! It works a lot BETTER now! Still not perfect, but the developer is working hard as hell to MAKE it perfect! Do you know how to OPEN apps??? Lol. Trust me everybody, it's usually USER ERROR, NOT developer error!!!  SERIOUSLY, THIS app is AWESOME!!!! AND GETTING BETTER ALL THE TIME!!!! GET IT!!!
One day and its so cool
It works for me I can't stand an application that has you do nothing but say the command over and over. This one works great.
I like jeanine or w e better.. change the voice of this bot etcetera and I'm all for you guys
Absolutely amasing. Takes my breath away!!! Great app. Thank you.
Absolutely amasing. Takes my breath away!!! Great app. Thank you.

Does everything you want it to! Great for texting on the road ha. If you have the text pop-up enabled and you get a long text message that comes in multiple texts you can even swipe back and forth between them to see all of the message. Customer service is awesome btw. Thanks Skyvi team!

Neat
Really cool. Still learning. But really really cool. My wife is jealous. Smart phones are only as smart as the aps they run; mine is smarter with skyvi.
I love this app !!!!
It's really fun and entertaining
Can it do everything Siri can in those commercials? No. Is it perfect?  Heck no.  Is it fun anyway?  Absolutely...  It's a fun toy more than a useful tool.  It will text and call people and do basic geographical searches as well as look up some things on the internet, but the logic and speech recognition isn't perfect.  Download and enjoy, but keep in mind that some of the responses may be a bit snarky if it doesn't know the answer.
Really good make things a lot easier  to do.
App
I've enjoyed it so far!
Very interesting
Love this app seriously

Great app
Great app only wish it did a few more thing such as reminders or alarms (ex: remind me to check stove in 5 mins, or, set alarm for 9am for work) that would make this app 100 times better. This apps definitely worth the download thou! Good job to the devz just please update soon!!!!
Why not
It helps me with everything I need to know.
Fantastic app, better and faster than s voice
This app is awesome.
This thing is the best ever no kidding

Great so far on galaxy s3. Just started.
A little difficult to use and annoying When she asks you to add a shortcut and give a 5 star revue.but its comparable to siri
Works good when u are in a hurry just gets the spelling off sometimes,but that happens when we text  too.
Love it!!!
Skyvi has helped,actually for being a computer.  Cheers to whoever made her!
a pure pleasure...I have not had any problems....does what it is supposed to.
I want it to be more friendly then robotic. Other wise great
She is actually quite funny...

Just like siri for the iPhone, ask it anything and it will answer. It even learns your name. It will give you directions to the nearest place you want to find and will also give you the weather forecast.
Works good
I was very impressed by the quality of this app! Terrific job!

Ive tried vlingo and iris. This app so far is more accurate and helpful.  I just started using it today.  But so far no mishaps and it was able to find malls  close to me and not 40 miles away.  I like the hands free option this app has.
Love this feature.!

Works fine, would like an ability to wake it up using only my voice. Tilting stops ur search. But most of all PLEASE ALLOW ME TO TURN OFF THE TIPS I know how to use it. It's pretty good at getting what I say. All around good app. For the price 5/5

Like i said
This is awesome.
Absolutely amazing. Galaxy nexus.
Who ever invented this app is SMART
Very intuitive
Has a much better sense of humor. Doesn't just pull up info. Actually explains it to you.
Awesome
My daughter had gotten me this app n i didnt know how to use it, but now i use it 24/7. Love this app. Dont change anything
Skyvi is a very fictional app that will not give you the world of head ache. Lets just say this im from a "third world country" and she works pretty good. I will download it if i was you
Good app
I love this app! Its a huge help and its pretty fun to play with. Lol
Just got it but seems pretty cool!

Its awesome I just love it
Since getting the galaxy 3 I've tried a few personal assistants trying to find one that fits me and my needs. This one opens fast and remembers all my data and previously entered info. Most of the time she understands correctly but I'm assuming the longer she is used the more accurate she'll be. Just need to give it time  and be patient. ..
Love it!!!!
Love it!!!!
No comment .... love it
Love this app so far
Good job
Awesome job developers.
Extremely helpful
This is a great app to have....it will help you find anything and give you a good laugh in the process
Really enjot it
I like it. Works well on my galaxy note
Great App
Hillarious

Great app
This is great app for android.Its awesome
This is great app for android.Its awesome

The voice sounds like a drunk Cathleen Turner's voice you should update that. It aint bad Thou
Great app as compared to other similar apps of it's kind. I look forward to seeing how far Skyvi develops.
This is brill very funny
Nice ap
Works
Voice regcognition could be improved.
Really good
This application is awesome, she learns names, numbers, txs people & ect. Its a must have
I really love this!!! Very accurate for me!
This is a good app well not as good as the real things but for a copy app its 5 stars dZ replys are prty good im happy with it
great app
I just got the app and was playing around with it. Very similar to Siri (iPhone) a definate download.
Skyri is awesome now I'm called Panic Defender
This app is awesome
Love this app dude!!!!
this is a very nice app chala chala chala bagundhi edi
Most fun of with an app I have had in so long. Need better voice recognition though!!
great app
Really cool app
Works goood
Good app has some funny answers
Pretty awesome. Really smart app with full responses and a sense of humor. Some miner glitches, like repeating a response three times in one, voice recognition is unable to interpret certain words, needs more options to customize, but overall It's a fantastic program. She remembers everything and learns new things easily. Great tool for quick info lookup, fun to talk to when you're bored, accuracy in responses is about 80-85% depending on question and recognition. Totally flipping awesome!!
So awsome
This is cool it really works (: Weird name though
Like it.
Very cool on the electrify
Its cool and helpfull
Ioving the app
Well worth the download
Love it
I like the app but im still having trouble posting on twitter and her robot voice can get pretty annoying. Otherwise a great app.
Love her she really helps a lot. Great App & Great Siri Replacement:)
Awsome
Thx, you've made a good app. So, i wont get bored. :)
I love it!!!! Please make the option to change the computers name,other than that it smart!
Its great
Totally obsessed!
Totally obsessed!
My very own assistant.
Its a realy a great apps of google play. But there is only system text to speech option. Please add a usa female voice for better voice clearty like speaktoit assistant. I am waiting for new update of voice option.
Just downloaded it but so far it's been very good and almost flawless. Would recommend again.
Outstanding app have seen till now..
I am SM challenged but this app makes it easier.
I love you siri
it a lot
Love it. It is perverted like me!
Can't decide between this one and "assistant", but both very, very good.
<3
Great App
Dude it's totally the future haha Im loving Skyvi! XD
I find apple products get to much credit. I like siri from apple though. This works just like it bet under stands you better.
Its great
Super cool , works great and its fast
Skyvi is awesome!!!
This app has the humor, ability to answer normal questions, and with ease AND ACCURACY instead of " weather in dallas,tx today" for example you can speak like a normal human saying "show me the weather please". It's answers are fast as lightning and with only one or two touches, personally having a disease related to that of parkinsons this app is a great help and the most accurate I've tried. With more updates and access I would happily pay the few dollars more. jeanie, assistant etc do not even compare.

Faster and smarter than the native S voice on the G s3 over WiFi
It does almost everything I say and always understands me
Ive only had the app a couple hours. I hadn't stop using it yet it would better if i had a couple diff choices of voices but other than that i think it compares to that i phone commercial with suri. I think its a great download
I love her!
Tons of fun but does require patience on user part. She doesn't hear her name very well.
only reason I wanted iphone 4s cuz of siri this app is wicked glad I stayed android boom!
Nice app. Like it

Nice on HTC thunderbolt
Its awesome. Very helpful. But I like asking it ridiculous questions!!! Lol

Works real good
Got this for when I receive text messages and I'm driving or otherwise occupied.  Easy to set up and use.  If it ever can integrate itself into my other apps and become usable with my bluetooth, I'll be in absolute heaven.  As it is, I can hear everything out of my BT, but Skyvi won't pick me up from it.
Love it
A Mazing app
